    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had always been an &amp;quot;anti e-book reader person&amp;quot;, or conversely, &amp;quot;pro physical book person&amp;quot;. In hindsight, I&#39;m not sure why: the constant argument had been &amp;quot;I&#39;d like to read &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; books, please!&amp;quot;. Hold them, carry them, feel them. Etc. etc. It&#39;s 150% the sentimentality around books as manifestation of a cultural thing that has been around for hundreds of years. The last bastion, where the digital revolution yet hasn&#39;t been able to put its bits-and-bytes hands on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also the vanity thing of collecting physical artefacts (and perhaps showing them off). I&#39;m the first to admit that I like to keep books in my bookshelf! Even though lately, I&#39;ve borrowed more books from the local library when the titles have been quite rando, as in &amp;quot;hm, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever gonna re-read this or recommend it to somebody&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow. With e-readers, you lose both the physical sensation and the showing-off of real books. And it&#39;s amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From now on, this text is about Johan being a decade late in discovering e-readers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a longer trip I&#39;m currently on, I bought myself an e-book reader. It&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://eu.kobobooks.com/sv/products/kobo-clara-2e&quot;&gt;Kobo Clara 2E&lt;/a&gt;. I refused Amazon&#39;s Kindles due to lock-in and dislike of Amazon. I got myself a magnetic cover, and off I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, I made damn sure this Kobo thing was &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; enough to transfer these types of ebooks onto it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random, free EPubs books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DRM protected EPub books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Library ebooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as well as sampling books out of the Kobo store. It supposedly has millions of books, and after some sampling, I determined that it had the titles I was going to read during my trip. Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://eu.kobobooks.com/cdn/shop/products/B_UK-ANZ-Device_Angled_1080x1080_17130470-23c2-498c-be24-8e5429a7f784_962x962.jpg?v=1691690100&quot; alt=&quot;Kobo Clara 2E&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kobo reader is really good. It has a great display, kind of water proof, has good battery life (I&#39;ve charged it once since I got it in mid January, now is late Feburary), a perfect form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form factor is something I especially appreciate: I can fit it in my back pocket. I don&#39;t think the display is too small at all (6 inches, 300 PPI). Anywhere when I got a minute over, I can just haul it up and get some pages read. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do the same with a physical book, but even a paperback of 600+ pages will be a bit of a brick to carry around. The result? I read in a much higher pace, and therefore a lot more books (since January 14th, I&#39;ve read four books for a total duration of 56 hours). I feel genuinely excited for how this has lowered the threshold for reading more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s almost like one of the charms with physical books became its baggage: to physically acquire them and transport them around. The ritual became a gatekeeping activity for me. With the e-book reader, it&#39;s as capitalistic and digital as it can be: I find a book in the Kobo store, buy it with my Apple Pay, and sync it on the device via my account. No more the feels of &amp;quot;opening the first pages of a freshly bought book&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I&#39;ve almost forgot &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; best thing about ebook readers! The ability to read in the evening in the bad shared with a partner who &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; want to have any lights on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m &lt;a href=&quot;https://johan.im/reading&quot;&gt;currently reading&lt;/a&gt; the &amp;quot;My Struggle&amp;quot; series by Karl Ove Knausgård.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;ve spent the past weeks in a beachside environment, with very few worries besides watching the baby
so she won&#39;t eat the sand, but I just don&#39;t care for a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; bit about new hardware announcements such as the Apple
Vision Pro any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s so relieving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not trying to be smug or snowflake about it. I simply feel so &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; those kinds of thought streams where I spend more
than a second checking the said hardware out.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We arrived to Koh Lanta a few days ago, where we&#39;ll spend the next two months. While I like long stays in locations, it doesn&#39;t come without risk. Especially when bringing kids. &amp;quot;Will we like it? Will it be boring? Will there be too many tourists? Will we be able to create an everyday life?&amp;quot; are questions which I&#39;ve had during the days up until arriving. I think this kind of travelling is one part experience and one part &amp;quot;Just Do It&amp;quot;. For experience: you just have to trust your gut instincts, and also your skills and ability to integrate well and have a good time. The &amp;quot;Just Do It&amp;quot; part is self-explanational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh Lanta is super so far though. We live just by Klong Dao beach, which is a super relaxed and cool beach: restaurants, bars, and cafés on one side, and looooong waves on the other. And yes: there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a ton of tourists (we among them!) — mostly Scandinavian — but I&#39;ve accepted that now (haha).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days in, we&#39;ve found some kind of a rhythm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early morning, I either sleep in and hang out with the kids, or do exercise (running or gym).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late morning, either me or my wife gets &amp;quot;off time&amp;quot;. The other one goes swimming with the kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At lunch, the baby sleeps and the older one hangs out inside for some calm time near the A/C. One of us parents
can go outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After lunch, we do some activity. For now that list still only consists of… more swimming 😅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late afternoon, it has gotten less hot outside, and we can hang out on the beach just by the shallow water where
the kids can play and we can bring takeaway thai food, while watching the beginning of the sunset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love so far with Koh Lanta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ease of living. Many things just exist at your doorstep. A decent supermarket, phone stores for prepaid SIM cards, cafés, cheap thai food joints, pad thai stands, drug stores. Products of years of mass tourism!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The picturesque beach. I have to pinch myself every morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pleasant locals. Not &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; are super happy and friendly (I reckon also a product of years of mass tourism!), but everybody &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; helpful and solutions oriented. They love babies so much, by the way. Everybody are smiling and acknowledging our 10 month old baby, who beams back at them. If I would do that back home in Stockholm… I… I don&#39;t know what would happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the heat that comes with tropical weather. It makes me a tad slower, but overall I prefer to be surrounded by warm 30°C air versus mere 20°C air (which we get in Sweden on averege in the summers, it feels like). A/Cs help a lot, sure. But even without them, I&#39;d just &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt; in the heat (and swim a lot).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was in a bookstore to get a Christmas gift today over lunch. It was an independent, small store — not one of the big book chains’ shops. Many books had small paper notes with the staff’s personal thoughts, and many were signed by the authors, who frequently visited the shop on signing events and book talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got a really fuzzy feeling entering the small venue, and even more so after chatting with the sole clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entering a bookstore is like entering a whole separate universe where time stands still. When I was travelling around in the world, I would always get to a bookstore when in a new city just to feel “rooted” — kind of like finding a safe house.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finished watching the David Beckham documentary. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it’s super produced and sanctioned by the Beckhams and all that. But. I liked it. Especially the ending, where the family hang out in present day England at their countryside estate. It felt real, in a way (even though again: I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; it’s staged 😄).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a cool story arch, even though I guess I appreciated it because of the nostalgia. The &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; when images appeared of Luis Figo, Zidane, Ronaldo, Rio Ferdinand, and Ryan Giggs and the others. I used to play Fifa 2003 on PC with those players, and they were all around when we were talking football in school.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arrow-js.com/&quot;&gt;ArrowJS&lt;/a&gt; is my spirit animal JS library at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you need a library on the frontend, I’d use this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ tiny (2kB). can read the source code in 10 min.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ reactive, with observable signals/atoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ no build, no JSX, no dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It abstracts away sharp edges with the DOM, and does the reactive boilerplate for you. I could easily just copy-paste the source into a vendor/ directory and call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Messing around with the styling and structure here on the website again. I&#39;m so inspired by all the personal sites I stumble on in my feed. But not inspired enough to actually produce as much content here as I would love to 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been reading a lot about &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components&quot;&gt;Web Components&lt;/a&gt; recently. They&#39;re having a sort of renaissance at the moment — not sure why this timing actually — much thanks to them being a tool in the box when building with progressive enhancement. All PE thought leaders are going on about the beauty of Web Components and &amp;quot;how you don&#39;t need any big JS or Virtual DOM libraries at all!!&amp;quot;. I get that for small, self-contained UI components, but for anything non-trivial, you&#39;re kind of bound to reinvent something inhouse for your app anyway, no? I guess Web Components fill the hole where you just want to drop a custom element in a piece of markup and have a Web Component use the element with contained JS and perhaps CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the idea of &amp;quot;HTML Web Components&amp;quot; is really neat, in the way it enhances existing markup. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;convert-currency to=&amp;quot;USD&amp;quot;&amp;gt;10&amp;lt;/convert-currency&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;convert-currency.js&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;// convert-currency.js
customElements.define(&#39;convert-currency&#39;, class extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
        // use this.querySelector() and other DOM API methods to convert
        // the text content to the currency from this.getAttribute(&amp;quot;to&amp;quot;).
    }
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For server rendered markup, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;convert-currency&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will render just fine, and &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; with it. Browsers will just ignore it when parsing the HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When parsing is done and JS kicks in, we&#39;ll &amp;quot;enrich&amp;quot; our custom element with logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My takeaway is that custom elements and Web Components give us a declarative way to encapsulate logic (duh, &amp;quot;components&amp;quot; it&#39;s in the name), which creates whole new patterns in how to approach component style architecture but &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; any 3rd party JS component library.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
