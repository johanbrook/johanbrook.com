            <p>i love this quote from Nils van der Poel (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it's important to understand that you're not doing it for a gold medal. <strong>Regardless of which life you chose to live, you will sacrifice something, that's the way it is.</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you go in one direction, you also choose to not go in all other directions at the same time. It's the basic precondition for going anywhere at all.</p>
<p>But on the path you take, you will experience fantastic things, even though it's uphill there will be a great view when you're at the top, and that's what makes it worth it, to be on this journey with people you love. It doesn't matter that much where the journey ends. A movie with a sad ending is also a good movie - and a movie with a nice ending makes you happy.</p>
<p>I'm very happy for this medal around my neck, and for getting all the way here. But why do you do it? I don't think you get to pick your dreams, they pick us. It's up to us to realize them or not, and it seems like people who try to realize their dreams are happier.</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>i'm switching to sublime text from vs code as main code editor, and man – it's much more config to do before it's usable to me. vs code follows more of a "batteries included" and "sensible defaults" approach.</p>

<p>the last one is especially interesting. as of january 2022, there's <strong>still no way to tell sublime to ignore files in <code>.gitignore</code></strong>. sublime should hide/gray out the files/folders in the sidebar, and <em>not</em> make them appear in the quick open dialog. so i have to add folders such as <code>node_modules</code> and <code>build</code> to the global config. people tell me to use some plugin (<code>sublime-gitignorer</code>), but meh... <a href="https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/2787">this issue</a> from 2019 is still open.</p>
<p>then i couldn't get the <code>editorconfig</code> plugin to work. i tried changing <code>indent_size</code> in my <code>.editorconfig</code> file, but the change wasn't reflected in the editor. joy.</p>
<p>then i realised that the typescript in sublime 4 isn't really "support": it's more "the syntax highlighting" is working. one has to install a typescript package for the Language Server Plugin for intellisense (completions, etc) to work. <a href="https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/typescript-is-not-there-yet-to-be-called-supported/58768">people don't like this</a>.</p>
<p>then i installed prettier along with the sublime plugin, but formatting on every save isn't viable since it's <em>very</em> slow. somebody online said that vs code's prettier extension is keeping long running node processes instead of spawning a single one for each save. sublime's plugin is evidently not doing that. may have to check out <a href="https://github.com/dprint/dprint-sublime">dprint</a>, but that plugin isn't even out in package control yet. hehe.</p>
<p>then there are these small annoyances like i can't do <code>backspace</code> to delete a file when it's focused in the sidebar. or hit <code>enter</code> to rename it. but no can do. like, what?! this is standard file explorer shortcuts? i timeboxed 5 min to find a keybinding but couldn't. i guess my mental model from atom and vs code differs from sublime's.</p>
<p>i'd really like more visual cues in the sidebar file tree about modified or added files, like vs codes does. makes it a lot easier to navigate.</p>
<hr>
<p>so is switching worth it? sublime is <em>so</em> much faster than the electron based editors it's ridiculous. when i'm comparing opening this repo's folder with <code>code .</code> and <code>subl .</code> from the command line, i understand how gaslighted i've been with the electron editors. sublime just flashes and it's open while vs code is busy booting another chromium app or whatever it's doing.</p>
<p>but i dislike having to carry around a set of plugins and settings when i switch computers. vs code has this nice settings sync feature built in, but i'm 100% sure i need to sort that out myself for sublime with some esoretic github gist based thing…</p>
<p>maybe <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/">Jetbrains Fleet</a> will be The One editor: native, without bloat, and configurable?</p>
<p>if anybody uses any life saving plugins for sublime, please <a href="/contact">give me a shout</a>.</p>

            <p>i love creating playlists. it's like the lost art of making mixtapes for yourself of somebody else. even though Spotify (and other services surely) have invested <em>a ton</em> content curation, i still love my own hand made playlists. spotify, for instance, have a lot of both automated and handmade playlists for a myriad of occasions. they're kinda niche and cool, but… i still think they're a bit bland.</p>
<p>what i appreciate is that it's a constant, living project. this categorisation builds up over time as i discover new material, and i'm now wired to place it in a playlist if i like the track. good for future johan and others.</p>
<p>here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Ldhvei26A52VXc1ErGFE3?si=7784bde2b4864c83">Johan Recommends 👌</a>. this one has been around since i got a beta invite to Spotify. i dunno, perhaps 2008? the listing doesn't tell the date of the two earliest tracks added (just a blank column). this playlist is just a dump of what i'm listening to at the moment. it forms a nice history of what i liked over the years.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2mtlhuFVOFMn6Ho3JmrLc2?si=01e2e74df939457c">☕ Programming</a>. music i code to. mostly techno and instrumental.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sQMuWwPINJiLZUJK4Z3uD?si=c1900108fe7946fa">👌 Feels Good Man</a>. reggae and dub. i've been listening to this constantly over the past year, haha. i just can't get over how good, deep, and rich this genre is.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5nh0YK8EONkjzOnbA3BhUY?si=bb2ee94098424d68">💑 Music for Eating</a> started as a playlist for a dinner in 2012, now it's my general "turn something on 5 min before guests arrive" kind of playlist. it's mostly "safe", as in "nobody and their partner will get annoyed by the songs in here".</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7q5ibEnI11LGt6OfPdUiYF?si=71eee722055a42e7">🎶 Music from the Old World</a>. i curate this one like a mad man. <strong>only</strong> good, timeless songs in here! think "if mankind would go under tomorrow, what would you save in a box and shoot out in outer space". this is music that i think are masterpieces and that has affected my interest in music somehow.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1gogip1RT6OUnbvdnTi6Pl?si=ac2453416add46c0">🍝 Cooking</a>. music i cook to! fun! creative!</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59nplETeaMx3BmSJ0HmueD?si=40dfed3c765943a3">🌧 Moody</a>. you know all these corny spotify playlists "Upbeat Summer" and that? this is the reverse. downbeat.</li>

<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3BNTm0AP9uiM0KIXc8iHEr?si=170da54d9da443c1">🇧🇷 Bom día, Rio de Janeeeeiroo!</a>. my brazilian playlist, which i created when i was in Rio. classic bossanova and samba mixed with brazilian funk.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJPfALfNLPFrq5gxWuude?si=982a8f0ae3e44338">🇸🇪 Absolute Swedish</a>. only swedish songs. makes me kind of proud over how much good music the little nation of sweden has produced.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6iXHobR6yJaPqgBaaL64xX?si=dd229408c5bf4121">🛣 On the Highway</a>. road trip songs without songs that mention "road trip".</li>

            <p>i've bought a new domain for this site! from now on, it's <a href="https://johan.im">johan.im</a>. short and sweet. johanbrook.com redirects to johan.im.</p>
<p>i appreciate these services/tools soooo much right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloudflare</li>
<li>Fastmail</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloudflare's dashboard is easy to understand and efficient enough to be dangerous — even though i'm not a DNS/networking/cache elite ninja. Cloudflare might look simplistic compared to beasts like AWS, but if you look under the hood, they support more than what they show off (perhaps they should show off more?). example: like the noob i am, i just redirected <code>johanbrook.com/* → johan.im/*</code>. but the paths after that slash of course weren't kept. so a URL <code>johanbrook.com/writings</code> would just end up at <code>johan.im</code> (the root). uh-oh. i read in a <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427#h_6N5SySNYCjYUUnCKnC1Ea6">help article</a> that Cloudflare's Page Rules feature supports <em>wildcard referencing</em>. tears of joy! so i could just do <code>johanbrook.com/* → johan.im/$1</code> to keep those nice paths.</p>
<p>Fastmail's wizard for adding a new custom domain is so lovely. i could even pick Cloudflare as my DNS manager, and they'd customise the wizard for Cloudflare's dashboard UI.</p>

            <p>the artist Meat Loaf died a few days ago. his album "Bat Out Of Hell" was the first album I recall playing on CD on my brand new music player when I was ~10 years old. that album – and especially the title track –&nbsp;was absolutely the thing that got me listening to classic rock as a kid, and then went on to widen my interest in music overall. i have such a strong memory of playing that album in my old room.</p>
<p>"Bat Out Of Hell" was so "grand and majestic", and the songs were sooo long. a stark contrast to the pop songs that was around in the 90s. and the guitar solos sure impressed me as a young child!</p>
<p>bye, Meat Loaf 💖</p>

            <p>hello world. this is me testing my new GUI for posting these small notes. i'll probably write a longer post about it later.</p>
<p>in a nutshell, i've written a <em>barebones</em> JS client to talk with GitHub's API to post a new file in this repo. no dependencies used. it was a fun challenge writing old school DOM JS manipulations again.</p>

            <p>i'm coding together something that will let me write post and notes in my static site from anywhere, and it's super fun. need to deal with github auth and their api, learning about Cloudflare Workers, and extending lume as i go.</p>
<p>the idea is to create a new post or note file with a request from an authed github session. not sure how generic i want to make this code – it could be of use for others. the existing "CMSes" i've seen for static pages are just <em>too</em> much.</p>

            <p>i've rewrote my site (using <a href="https://lumeland.github.io">lume</a> 💛) and made a ton of tweaks. classic neverending parental leave chores. it's built with <a href="https://deno.land">deno</a>, which I love even more. i'm finally free from the node/npm APIs and build systems! everything is much simpler now, and i should probably write about it in the even more classic post of "i've rewritten my blog" which usually shows up in January every year.</p>

            <p>Summer is over, after vacation in August down on the Swedish west and south coasts. Weather was so-so, but it was nice with a change of scenery. We also spent the month of September in Florence, Italy, which was such a blast. We travelled abroad with our 10 months old daughter for the first time, and everything went quite well actually (I had expected the worst). I was so inspired by the stay in Italy, and hope I can bring some of that energy into the day-to-day life back in Sweden.</p>
<p>On Monday I'll officially start my parental leave until April 2022. Scary but exciting. I'm actually looking forward to just <em>not work</em> for the first time in 7 years. Who knows what kind of person I'll be after this leave?</p>
<p>I was inspired by the book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" by Haruki Murakami, so I want to start running this Autumn.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to start making my own pasta. I took a pasta making course in Florence, and it was super fun. So simple! So fresh!</p>

            <p>Last day in the Swedish mountains, after a week of chilling and hiking. I wonder if I'd like living here for longer periods of time, or if I'd get cabin fever. I think I'd adjust, but friends and family are far away.</p>
<p>Still learning programming in Rust. Still not 100% sure of what I'm doing when it comes to memory management, but the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">official guide</a> and <a href="https://www.possiblerust.com/">"Possible Rust"</a> have been of huge help. Rust feels like a very "intellectual" language (sooo much language theory has gone into it!), but I'm struck every day of how friendly the documentation and 3rd party writings on the language are. I think a super good way of learning Rust would be to actually pair program with some existing Rust programmer you know, in a non-trivial project. So that you can ask about all the small things you run into, and can be unblocked and learn forever.</p>
<p>I'm going to be on parental leave from October until ~April 2022. Am nervous, but looking forward. Will be a bit weird to be off work for 6 months since I started. But I have zero doubts in that I'll be able to chill in the new role of being a parent 100% of the time. I'll miss coding for work though, BUT I guess I'll need to find myself a sIdE PrOjEct like everybody else?!</p>
