I'm so inspired by all the personal sites I stumble on in my feed. But not inspired enough to actually produce as much content here as I would love to 😄<p>Been reading a lot about <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components>Web Components</a> recently. They're having a sort of renaissance at the moment — not sure why this timing actually — much thanks to them being a tool in the box when building with progressive enhancement. All PE thought leaders are going on about the beauty of Web Components and "how you don't need any big JS or Virtual DOM libraries at all!!". I get that for small, self-contained UI components, but for anything non-trivial, you're kind of bound to reinvent something inhouse for your app anyway, no? I guess Web Components fill the hole where you just want to drop a custom element in a piece of markup and have a Web Component use the element with contained JS and perhaps CSS.<p>But the idea of "HTML Web Components" is really neat, in the way it enhances existing markup. Like this:<pre class=language-html><code class=language-html><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation"><</span>convert-currency</span> <span class="token attr-name">to</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>USD<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>10<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&LT/</span>convert-currency</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

It's based on the book with the famous title, a source of many dad phrasings over the years (dads throwing in the reference "all quiet on the Western front" in conversations when receiving the question "how do you do"). The film was amazing in the sense of production, but also (I guess) authenticity (the dialogue is German 💞).

It's the basic precondition for going anywhere at all.<p>But on the path you take, you will experience fantastic things, even though it's uphill there will be a great view when you're at the top, and that's what makes it worth it, to be on this journey with people you love. It doesn't matter that much where the journey ends. A movie with a sad ending is also a good movie - and a movie with a nice ending makes you happy.<p>I'm very happy for this medal around my neck, and for getting all the way here. But why do you do it? I don't think you get to pick your dreams, they pick us.

</code></pre><p>the last one is especially interesting. as of january 2022, there's <strong>still no way to tell sublime to ignore files in <code>.gitignore</code></strong>. sublime should hide/gray out the files/folders in the sidebar, and <em>not</em> make them appear in the quick open dialog. so i have to add folders such as <code>node_modules</code> and <code>build</code> to the global config. people tell me to use some plugin (<code>sublime-gitignorer</code>), but meh... <a href=https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/2787>this issue</a> from 2019 is still open.<p>then i couldn't get the <code>editorconfig</code> plugin to work. i tried changing <code>indent_size</code> in my <code>.editorconfig</code> file, but the change wasn't reflected in the editor. joy.<p>then i realised that the typescript in sublime 4 isn't really "support": it's more "the syntax highlighting" is working. one has to install a typescript package for the Language Server Plugin for intellisense (completions, etc) to work. <a href=https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/typescript-is-not-there-yet-to-be-called-supported/58768>people don't like this</a>.<p>then i installed prettier along with the sublime plugin, but formatting on every save isn't viable since it's <em>very</em> slow. somebody online said that vs code's prettier extension is keeping long running node processes instead of spawning a single one for each save. sublime's plugin is evidently not doing that. may have to check out <a href=https://github.com/dprint/dprint-sublime>dprint</a>, but that plugin isn't even out in package control yet. hehe.<p>then there are these small annoyances like i can't do <code>backspace</code> to delete a file when it's focused in the sidebar. or hit <code>enter</code> to rename it. but no can do. like, what?! this is standard file explorer shortcuts? i timeboxed 5 min to find a keybinding but couldn't. i guess my mental model from atom and vs code differs from sublime's.<p>i'd really like more visual cues in the sidebar file tree about modified or added files, like vs codes does. makes it a lot easier to navigate.<hr><p>so is switching worth it? sublime is <em>so</em> much faster than the electron based editors it's ridiculous. when i'm comparing opening this repo's folder with <code>code .</code> and <code>subl .</code> from the command line, i understand how gaslighted i've been with the electron editors. sublime just flashes and it's open while vs code is busy booting another chromium app or whatever it's doing.<p>but i dislike having to carry around a set of plugins and settings when i switch computers. vs code has this nice settings sync feature built in, but i'm 100% sure i need to sort that out myself for sublime with some esoretic github gist based thing…<p>maybe <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/>Jetbrains Fleet</a> will be The One editor: native, without bloat, and configurable?<p>if anybody uses any life saving plugins for sublime, please <a href=/contact>give me a shout</a>.</div></article><li><article class=Note><header class=mb2><h1 class="f4 no-rhythm mb0"><a class="font-serif no-underline target"href=/mind/20220202175148/ title=Permalink>February 2nd, 2022 — 17:51 <span>#</span></a></h1><p class="muted font-sans mb0 f5 target"title="Posted from">My couch in Stockholm</header><div class=prose><p>i love creating playlists. it's like the lost art of making mixtapes for yourself of somebody else. even though Spotify (and other services surely) have invested <em>a ton</em> content curation, i still love my own hand made playlists. spotify, for instance, have a lot of both automated and handmade playlists for a myriad of occasions. they're kinda niche and cool, but… i still think they're a bit bland.<p>what i appreciate is that it's a constant, living project. this categorisation builds up over time as i discover new material, and i'm now wired to place it in a playlist if i like the track. good for future johan and others.<p>here are some of them:<ul><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Ldhvei26A52VXc1ErGFE3?si=7784bde2b4864c83">Johan Recommends 👌</a>. this one has been around since i got a beta invite to Spotify. i dunno, perhaps 2008?

Still not 100% sure of what I'm doing when it comes to memory management, but the <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>official guide</a> and <a href=https://www.possiblerust.com/>"Possible Rust"</a> have been of huge help. Rust feels like a very "intellectual" language (sooo much language theory has gone into it!), but I'm struck every day of how friendly the documentation and 3rd party writings on the language are. I think a super good way of learning Rust would be to actually pair program with some existing Rust programmer you know, in a non-trivial project. So that you can ask about all the small things you run into, and can be unblocked and learn forever.<p>I'm going to be on parental leave from October until ~April 2022.

I'll miss coding for work though, BUT I guess I'll need to find myself a sIdE PrOjEct like everybody else?!</div></article></ol></main><footer role=contentinfo><nav><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=/feed.xml title=Atom>Post feed</a><li><a href=/micro.xml title=Atom>Micro feed</a><li><a href=/reading.xml title=Atom>Reading feed</a></ul></nav></footer></div><nav class=MainNav role=navigation><div class=sticky><h1 class="f4 sr-only-mobile"><a aria-label=Home href=/> <span>Johan Brook</span><span class="BackLink ml2"aria-hidden=true>←</span> </a></h1><ul><li class=only-mobile><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=/now/>Now</a><li aria-current=page><a href=/mind/>Micro</a><li><a href=/about/>About</a><li><a href=/reading/>Reading</a><li><a href=/writings/>Writings</a></ul><details><summary class="mv1 font-sans f5 muted link fw5">View more</summary> <ul><li><a href=/to-read/>To read</a><li><a href=/quotes/>Quotes</a><li><a href=/changelog/>Changelog</a><li><a href=/credits/>Credits</a></ul></details></div></nav></div><script>if(window.location.host!==new URL('https://johan.im').host){window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}};if(window.location.hash==='#skipgc')localStorage.setItem('skipgc','t');if(localStorage.getItem('skipgc')==='t')window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}</script><script async data-goatcounter=https://johanbrook.goatcounter.com/count src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script>
