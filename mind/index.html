<h1>September 30th, 2021</h1>
<p>Summer is over, after vacation in August down on the Swedish west and south coasts. Weather was so-so, but it was nice with a change of scenery. We also spent the month of September in Florence, Italy, which was such a blast. We travelled abroad with our 10 months old daughter for the first time, and everything went quite well actually (I had expected the worst). I was so inspired by the stay in Italy, and hope I can bring some of that energy into the day-to-day life back in Sweden.</p>
<p>On Monday I'll officially start my parental leave until April 2022. Scary but exciting. I'm actually looking forward to just <em>not work</em> for the first time in 7 years. Who knows what kind of person I'll be after this leave?</p>
<p>I was inspired by the book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" by Haruki Murakami, so I want to start running this Autumn.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to start making my own pasta. I took a pasta making course in Florence, and it was super fun. So simple! So fresh!</p>

<h1>July 9th, 2021</h1>
<p>Last day in the Swedish mountains, after a week of chilling and hiking. I wonder if I'd like living here for longer periods of time, or if I'd get cabin fever. I think I'd adjust, but friends and family are far away.</p>
<p>Still learning programming in Rust. Still not 100% sure of what I'm doing when it comes to memory management, but the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">official guide</a> and <a href="https://www.possiblerust.com/">"Possible Rust"</a> have been of huge help. Rust feels like a very "intellectual" language (sooo much language theory has gone into it!), but I'm struck every day of how friendly the documentation and 3rd party writings on the language are. I think a super good way of learning Rust would be to actually pair program with some existing Rust programmer you know, in a non-trivial project. So that you can ask about all the small things you run into, and can be unblocked and learn forever.</p>
<p>I'm going to be on parental leave from October until ~April 2022. Am nervous, but looking forward. Will be a bit weird to be off work for 6 months since I started. But I have zero doubts in that I'll be able to chill in the new role of being a parent 100% of the time. I'll miss coding for work though, BUT I guess I'll need to find myself a sIdE PrOjEct like everybody else?!</p>
