            <p>i love creating playlists. it's like the lost art of making mixtapes for yourself of somebody else. even though Spotify (and other services surely) have invested <em>a ton</em> content curation, i still love my own hand made playlists. spotify, for instance, have a lot of both automated and handmade playlists for a myriad of occasions. they're kinda niche and cool, but… i still think they're a bit bland.</p>
<p>what i appreciate is that it's a constant, living project. this categorisation builds up over time as i discover new material, and i'm now wired to place it in a playlist if i like the track. good for future johan and others.</p>
<p>here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Ldhvei26A52VXc1ErGFE3?si=7784bde2b4864c83">Johan Recommends 👌</a>. this one has been around since i got a beta invite to Spotify. i dunno, perhaps 2008? the listing doesn't tell the date of the two earliest tracks added (just a blank column). this playlist is just a dump of what i'm listening to at the moment. it forms a nice history of what i liked over the years.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2mtlhuFVOFMn6Ho3JmrLc2?si=01e2e74df939457c">☕ Programming</a>. music i code to. mostly techno and instrumental.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sQMuWwPINJiLZUJK4Z3uD?si=c1900108fe7946fa">👌 Feels Good Man</a>. reggae and dub. i've been listening to this constantly over the past year, haha. i just can't get over how good, deep, and rich this genre is.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5nh0YK8EONkjzOnbA3BhUY?si=bb2ee94098424d68">💑 Music for Eating</a> started as a playlist for a dinner in 2012, now it's my general "turn something on 5 min before guests arrive" kind of playlist. it's mostly "safe", as in "nobody and their partner will get annoyed by the songs in here".</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7q5ibEnI11LGt6OfPdUiYF?si=71eee722055a42e7">🎶 Music from the Old World</a>. i curate this one like a mad man. <strong>only</strong> good, timeless songs in here! think "if mankind would go under tomorrow, what would you save in a box and shoot out in outer space". this is music that i think are masterpieces and that has affected my interest in music somehow.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1gogip1RT6OUnbvdnTi6Pl?si=ac2453416add46c0">🍝 Cooking</a>. music i cook to! fun! creative!</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59nplETeaMx3BmSJ0HmueD?si=40dfed3c765943a3">🌧 Moody</a>. you know all these corny spotify playlists "Upbeat Summer" and that? this is the reverse. downbeat.</li>

<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/078GhmeGcbKJgRZD8dy6Rk?si=d2e15235ff4e45cf">🌞 Music I've Grown Up To</a>. songs i've listened through from teen to adolescence. music that somehow has affected me during emo periods, travels, and just everyday life.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3BNTm0AP9uiM0KIXc8iHEr?si=170da54d9da443c1">🇧🇷 Bom día, Rio de Janeeeeiroo!</a>. my brazilian playlist, which i created when i was in Rio. classic bossanova and samba mixed with brazilian funk.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJPfALfNLPFrq5gxWuude?si=982a8f0ae3e44338">🇸🇪 Absolute Swedish</a>. only swedish songs. makes me kind of proud over how much good music the little nation of sweden has produced.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6iXHobR6yJaPqgBaaL64xX?si=dd229408c5bf4121">🛣 On the Highway</a>. road trip songs without songs that mention "road trip".</li>

            <p>i've bought a new domain for this site! from now on, it's <a href="https://johan.im">johan.im</a>. short and sweet. johanbrook.com redirects to johan.im.</p>
<p>i appreciate these services/tools soooo much right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloudflare</li>
<li>Fastmail</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloudflare's dashboard is easy to understand and efficient enough to be dangerous — even though i'm not a DNS/networking/cache elite ninja. Cloudflare might look simplistic compared to beasts like AWS, but if you look under the hood, they support more than what they show off (perhaps they should show off more?). example: like the noob i am, i just redirected <code>johanbrook.com/* → johan.im/*</code>. but the paths after that slash of course weren't kept. so a URL <code>johanbrook.com/writings</code> would just end up at <code>johan.im</code> (the root). uh-oh. i read in a <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427#h_6N5SySNYCjYUUnCKnC1Ea6">help article</a> that Cloudflare's Page Rules feature supports <em>wildcard referencing</em>. tears of joy! so i could just do <code>johanbrook.com/* → johan.im/$1</code> to keep those nice paths.</p>
<p>Fastmail's wizard for adding a new custom domain is so lovely. i could even pick Cloudflare as my DNS manager, and they'd customise the wizard for Cloudflare's dashboard UI.</p>

            <p>the artist Meat Loaf died a few days ago. his album "Bat Out Of Hell" was the first album I recall playing on CD on my brand new music player when I was ~10 years old. that album – and especially the title track –&nbsp;was absolutely the thing that got me listening to classic rock as a kid, and then went on to widen my interest in music overall. i have such a strong memory of playing that album in my old room.</p>
<p>"Bat Out Of Hell" was so "grand and majestic", and the songs were sooo long. a stark contrast to the pop songs that was around in the 90s. and the guitar solos sure impressed me as a young child!</p>
<p>bye, Meat Loaf 💖</p>

            <p>hello world. this is me testing my new GUI for posting these small notes. i'll probably write a longer post about it later.</p>
<p>in a nutshell, i've written a <em>barebones</em> JS client to talk with GitHub's API to post a new file in this repo. no dependencies used. it was a fun challenge writing old school DOM JS manipulations again.</p>

<p>the idea is to create a new post or note file with a request from an authed github session. not sure how generic i want to make this code – it could be of use for others. the existing "CMSes" i've seen for static pages are just <em>too</em> much.</p>

            <p>Summer is over, after vacation in August down on the Swedish west and south coasts. Weather was so-so, but it was nice with a change of scenery. We also spent the month of September in Florence, Italy, which was such a blast. We travelled abroad with our 10 months old daughter for the first time, and everything went quite well actually (I had expected the worst). I was so inspired by the stay in Italy, and hope I can bring some of that energy into the day-to-day life back in Sweden.</p>
<p>On Monday I'll officially start my parental leave until April 2022. Scary but exciting. I'm actually looking forward to just <em>not work</em> for the first time in 7 years. Who knows what kind of person I'll be after this leave?</p>
<p>I was inspired by the book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" by Haruki Murakami, so I want to start running this Autumn.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to start making my own pasta. I took a pasta making course in Florence, and it was super fun. So simple! So fresh!</p>

            <p>Last day in the Swedish mountains, after a week of chilling and hiking. I wonder if I'd like living here for longer periods of time, or if I'd get cabin fever. I think I'd adjust, but friends and family are far away.</p>
<p>Still learning programming in Rust. Still not 100% sure of what I'm doing when it comes to memory management, but the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">official guide</a> and <a href="https://www.possiblerust.com/">"Possible Rust"</a> have been of huge help. Rust feels like a very "intellectual" language (sooo much language theory has gone into it!), but I'm struck every day of how friendly the documentation and 3rd party writings on the language are. I think a super good way of learning Rust would be to actually pair program with some existing Rust programmer you know, in a non-trivial project. So that you can ask about all the small things you run into, and can be unblocked and learn forever.</p>
<p>I'm going to be on parental leave from October until ~April 2022. Am nervous, but looking forward. Will be a bit weird to be off work for 6 months since I started. But I have zero doubts in that I'll be able to chill in the new role of being a parent 100% of the time. I'll miss coding for work though, BUT I guess I'll need to find myself a sIdE PrOjEct like everybody else?!</p>
