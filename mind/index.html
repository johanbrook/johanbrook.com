            <p>the artist Meat Loaf died a few days ago. his album "Bat Out Of Hell" was the first album I recall playing on CD on my brand new music player when I was ~10 years old. that album – and especially the title track –&nbsp;was absolutely the thing that got me listening to classic rock as a kid, and then went on to widen my interest in music overall. i have such a strong memory of playing that album in my old room.</p>
<p>"Bat Out Of Hell" was so "grand and majestic", and the songs were sooo long. a stark contrast to the pop songs that was around in the 90s. and the guitar solos sure impressed me as a young child!</p>
<p>bye, Meat Loaf 💖</p>

            <p>hello world. this is me testing my new GUI for posting these small notes. i'll probably write a longer post about it later.</p>
<p>in a nutshell, i've written a <em>barebones</em> JS client to talk with GitHub's API to post a new file in this repo. no dependencies used. it was a fun challenge writing old school DOM JS manipulations again.</p>

            <p>i'm coding together something that will let me write post and notes in my static site from anywhere, and it's super fun. need to deal with github auth and their api, learning about Cloudflare Workers, and extending lume as i go.</p>
<p>the idea is to create a new post or note file with a request from an authed github session. not sure how generic i want to make this code – it could be of use for others. the existing "CMSes" i've seen for static pages are just <em>too</em> much.</p>

            <p>i've rewrote my site (using <a href="https://lumeland.github.io">lume</a> 💛) and made a ton of tweaks. classic neverending parental leave chores. it's built with <a href="https://deno.land">deno</a>, which I love even more. i'm finally free from the node/npm APIs and build systems! everything is much simpler now, and i should probably write about it in the even more classic post of "i've rewritten my blog" which usually shows up in January every year.</p>

            <p>Summer is over, after vacation in August down on the Swedish west and south coasts. Weather was so-so, but it was nice with a change of scenery. We also spent the month of September in Florence, Italy, which was such a blast. We travelled abroad with our 10 months old daughter for the first time, and everything went quite well actually (I had expected the worst). I was so inspired by the stay in Italy, and hope I can bring some of that energy into the day-to-day life back in Sweden.</p>
<p>On Monday I'll officially start my parental leave until April 2022. Scary but exciting. I'm actually looking forward to just <em>not work</em> for the first time in 7 years. Who knows what kind of person I'll be after this leave?</p>
<p>I was inspired by the book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" by Haruki Murakami, so I want to start running this Autumn.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to start making my own pasta. I took a pasta making course in Florence, and it was super fun. So simple! So fresh!</p>

            <p>Last day in the Swedish mountains, after a week of chilling and hiking. I wonder if I'd like living here for longer periods of time, or if I'd get cabin fever. I think I'd adjust, but friends and family are far away.</p>
<p>Still learning programming in Rust. Still not 100% sure of what I'm doing when it comes to memory management, but the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">official guide</a> and <a href="https://www.possiblerust.com/">"Possible Rust"</a> have been of huge help. Rust feels like a very "intellectual" language (sooo much language theory has gone into it!), but I'm struck every day of how friendly the documentation and 3rd party writings on the language are. I think a super good way of learning Rust would be to actually pair program with some existing Rust programmer you know, in a non-trivial project. So that you can ask about all the small things you run into, and can be unblocked and learn forever.</p>
<p>I'm going to be on parental leave from October until ~April 2022. Am nervous, but looking forward. Will be a bit weird to be off work for 6 months since I started. But I have zero doubts in that I'll be able to chill in the new role of being a parent 100% of the time. I'll miss coding for work though, BUT I guess I'll need to find myself a sIdE PrOjEct like everybody else?!</p>
