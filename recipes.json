Pat dry with a paper towel. Rub it with </span><span title=\"some \" class=\"recipe--ingredient\">salt</span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\"> and </span><span title=\"some \" class=\"recipe--ingredient\">black pepper</span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">.</span></li>\n<li><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">Put the oven on 200˚C (~180˚C for a convection oven).</span></li>\n<li><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">Brush some </span><span title=\"some \" class=\"recipe--ingredient\">butter</span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\"> on the surfaces of an oven safe </span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--cookware\">casserole</span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">. Put the chicken in it.</span></li>\n<li><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">Make a glazing by combining </span><span title=\"1 dl\" class=\"recipe--ingredient\">oyster sauce</span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">, </span><span title=\"1 tbsp\" class=\"recipe--ingredient\">soy</span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">, </span><span title=\"1 tbsp\" class=\"recipe--ingredient\">sesame oil</span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">, </span><span title=\"1 \" class=\"recipe--ingredient\">juice of one lemon</span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\"> (save the squeezed out fruit), and </span><span title=\"2 tbsp\" class=\"recipe--ingredient\">sugar</span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\"> (can be substituted with honey, it's actually nicer. Both will give a nice surface to the grilled chicken). You can pretty much freewheel here from what you have at home. Maybe something spicy: sriracha?</span></li>\n<li><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">Brush almost all of the glazing onto the chicken. Try to get glazing onto all crevices.</span></li>\n<li><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">Put the casserole with chicken into the oven for </span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--timer\">40 minutes </span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">.</span></li>\n<li><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">When it's </span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--timer\">5 minutes </span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\"> left: rub the chicken with the remaining lemon shell, put the remaining glazing on, put it back into the oven and turn on the grill function of the oven and keep an eye on the chicken so it won't get burnt.</span></li>\n<li><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">Bring the chicken out of the oven, check the temperature in the breast and close to a bone (google for appropriate temperatures). I usually bring it out at 75˚C and let it rest for </span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--timer\">5 minutes </span><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">.</span></li>\n<li><span title=\"\" class=\"recipe--text\">Serve with steamed rice and smashed cucumber.</span></li>\n    </ol>\n</section>","date_published":"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 18:52:55 GMT"}]}
