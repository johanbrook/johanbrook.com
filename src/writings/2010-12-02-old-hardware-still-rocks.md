![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/364076/ipod-fourth-generation.jpg "iPod 4G") Great piece by Milind Alvares about using older Apple hardware (in his case an iBook G4). I think it's a very interesting discussion: you don't always need the latest and greatest, even though Apple's products have that effect on you. Sometimes it's about a sentimental bond to an object (I had a hard time giving up my old iPhone 3G) and other times it's just not necessary to get a new one. The idea of using a "lesser" machine where I have constraints is quite thrilling, to be honest. It's a minimalist computer where I maybe can't runt all these fancy, heavy, Snow Leopard-y applications â€“ instead I have to use simpler software and make the most of it. I know David Heinemeier Hansson said something similar, but I think that I _work better with constraints_. That's the reason I'm currently looking for an original iPod (preferably the one with touch wheel). Wouldn't it be nice to play plain, simple music without having a big-ass multitouch screen, cameras, Twitter apps and stuff on it? Give me a shout if you see one!
