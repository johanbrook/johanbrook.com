Sigh.Â I wasn't happy with the last one. Overly complex and not straight to the point. So I sat down one evening, pretty casual, and I created something. I continued to experiment and in two days I had created a completely new look, and I liked it. This one features a more cleaner layout (responsive, of course) and clearer typography. I've put more attention to quickies I post and made some improvements to the HTML markup. But, the breaking news is the [work page](http://johanbrook.com/work). I've finally put together something similar to a portfolio, although it's pretty humble. You're welcomed to have a look. For Swedish readers I've created a [micro-site promoting me and my skills](http://jobbamed.johanbrook.com). It's in Swedish, but the design is pretty slick (the markup is _sexy_). Thanks for dropping by, and enjoy the new appearance. I hope I get some more motivation to write some more journal posts now ...
