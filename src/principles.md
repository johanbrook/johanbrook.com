1. I should always try to have a clear mind.
2. I don't always have to have an opinion about a given subject.
3. I should be tolerant, accepting, and non-judgmental of people. It takes all sorts to make a world.
4. Think before you buy. Do you research. Spend more on quality that lasts longer.
5. Try to buy as much as possible locally.
