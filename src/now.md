This page reflects what I'm doing with my life at the moment, since it's the most common question on the internet and in real life anyway.

**So.**

I have the privilege of traveling while working remotely (doing this nomad thing). My current travel plans are:

1. 🇦🇹 ~~**Vienna**~~, Austria (October, 2015)
2. 🇺🇸 ~~**San Francisco**~~, U.S. (October-November, 2015)
3. 🇬🇧 ~~**London**~~, UK (November-December, 2015)
4. 🇩🇰 ~~**Copenhagen**~~, Denmark (December, 2015)
5. 🇸🇪 ~~**Sweden**~~ (December, 2015)
6. 🇪🇸 ~~**Madrid**~~, Spain (January)
7. 🇵🇾 ~~**Asunción**~~, Paraguay (February-April, *if El Niño doesn't fuck the country over again*)
8. 🇺🇸 ~~**San Diego**~~, U.S. (March)
9. 🇧🇷 **Rio de Janeiro**, Brazil (April-late May). View some [photos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/riosexton/) from me and my friends.
10. 🇸🇪 **Gothenburg**, Sweden (May-September)
11. 🇺🇸 **New York**, U.S. Preliminary (September-October)

I spend my time on these things:

- working in [Lookback](http://lookback.io) as web app developer and designer. Mostly doing product and writing Javascript in [Meteor](http://meteor.com).
- reading books and articles, in order to get my mind off the digital things. Ironically, I mostly read articles on product design, code, and startups.
- I'm currently reading *A Moveable Feast* by Hemingway. Previously, I read *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* by Robert Hirsig.
- meeting new people in the cities I visit, as well as connecting with existing ones.
- trying to come up with a nice side project. I think I'm on to something, and it involves [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) and [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org).
- photo snapping and travel memories collecting on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/johanbrook/).
- playing the guitar. I usually play music by the Swedish artist Håkan Hellström.
- learning Portuguese on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/johanbrook).
- writing [open source packages for Meteor](https://atmospherejs.com/lookback/).
- trying to write more articles on this site.

If my life changes, I'll update this page.
