## Back in Sweden

We flew back to Stockholm in March. Lots of mixed feelings. The only thing that made us go home, really, was the South African visa laws. I loved being in Cape Town. I had the everyday routines I like in a society full of mixed cultures and languages, in a climate which was just perfect.

It sounds bleak, but I didn't really long back to Sweden one bit. After travelling a ton in my 20s, it felt good to settle for a while, but now that urge is _gone_. The world is too cool to not be travelled, and I especially want to be abroad while the kids are young and easy to move around.

During the Spring, we've had lots of friends over (even though it's been so cold), and generally settled back into routines with preschool and work.

## Travelling

In June I went to New York City with friends. I was there last time in 2016 for two months, and I totally forgotten how _super cool_ the city is. It's connected with the other headline above, but my god I enjoyed being in another culture.

For the Summer, we have just very humble plans. In July, I'm still working, but maybe from my parents' farm where the kids can hang out with animals. And hopefully there are people left in Stockholm we can do day trips with. We're going to be off for three weeks in late July-early August to see a bunch of friends on the Swedish west coast.

## Exercising

There's a new outdoor gym where I live, which is slightly higher quality than the usual outdoor variants. Meaning, one can adjust the weights to get more precise movements. Super nice.

Still running, but not long nor fast, haha.

## Reading

I'm done with my South African theme for now, and after a brief contemptorary read of [_Careless People_](/reading/careless-people), I'm back on my bullshit with Eastern Germany with [_Beyond the Wall_](/reading/beyond-the-wall).

## Learning

### Languages

I'm toiling on with my Italian Duolingo exercises each day: now on a 700+ day streak! I've eyed some proper university level classes in beginner Italian at some schools here, maybe I'll take one on 50% and remote during next Spring.

### Programming

At work, I've been coding some Rust. This excites me. I've given it a couple of tries before, but honestly, with the advent of <abbr title="Large Language Models>LLMs</abbr>, learning Rust is way more enjoyable than it was before in my case.

I do believe in reading documentation, tutorials, language walkthroughs, and other materials the language maintainers have produced. That's the canon, and _learning how to learn_ is essential. But when I get stuck on tiny, random things in syntax, patterns, or, yeah, the borrow checked, asking an LLM takes me 90% there in understanding. Previously, I would've jumped to Google or Stack Overflow (RIP) for generic answers and translated it to _my specific problem_. With an LLM, I get (mostly) correct answers about the exact code I'm working on.

Will it make me lazier in finding information? Perhaps. That's why I want to keep a balance in using LLMs in my day-to-day coding. I want to keep my brain sharp. What I don't want is to waste my few spare hours trying to piece together enough information to keep my learning momentum up.

### Computers

Still very keen on [running Linux](/micro/20250122202157/) at some point. Not sure when. Getting more and more sick of Apple's bullshit software, both on macOS and iOS. Their hardware is however, sadly, superb, so it's going to be hard to give up on that if I want to run Linux on a PC like [Framework](https://frame.work).

### Cooking

I bought myself a new pan some weeks ago: a Scanpan Fusion 5 on a deal. It's stainless steel, which makes it good for searing stuff, as well as cooking with acid (wine, tomatoes, citrus), as all of my other pans are cast iron. It's super fun to cooking with, to be honest. And both NYTimes Cooking and Serious Eats are providing great recipes which are sometimes a bit more advanced than the run-to-the-mill first hit on Google.

Since South Africa, I've taken more interest in wine than before. Especially Pinot Noirs. The prices in Sweden are _horrible_ though, but whaddayagonnado. I'd love to take a wine course which is not "top notch sommelier", but a bit more advanced and continous than what you read about in magazines.
