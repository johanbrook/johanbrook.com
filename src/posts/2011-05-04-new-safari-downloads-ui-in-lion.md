**Looks like we’re getting a new downloads UI in Safari.** In the latest OS X Lion build there’s a
popover revealing current and finished downloads, activated with a button just right of the search
engine field in the toolbar. I like it.

The upcoming downloads popover

All major browsers implements some kind of download manager: either a separate window (Safari,
Firefox) or a separate tab (Chrome, Opera). I’m not a huge fan of either of them:

- The separate window model makes me want to close the window after the download finishes. It’s just
  clutter anyway. I want it out of my way. This was automatically done for me in Firefox, but not in
  Safari until quite late. However, I don’t like having a completely separate window layer for
  downloads – if you ask me, their level of importance can’t justify a new window.
- A new tab for downloads? No, no, no. You don’t think I’ve got tons of tabs open already? I don’t
  want to lose another one … This is too far away in the opposite direction of the point above –
  downloads are more important than regular web pages, but less important than a new browser window.

This download UI is a great start: it’s unobstrusive, doesn’t get in my way, and it’s always
accessible. I won’t have to navigate to a specific tab, or find this special window.

As [Alexander Limi](http://twitter.com/limi) of the Firefox UX team writes (
[http://limi.net/articles/safari-downloads/](http://limi.net/articles/safari-downloads/)), he and
the rest of the team proposed this kind of behavior some time ago, exploring the concept in
[an in-depth article](http://limi.net/articles/improving-download-behaviors-web-browsers) (I really
recommend it – great usability and problem solving discussion).

I truly hope this UI widget will make it to the final version of Lion.
