I got myself a new wrist watch today. It's from Timex – a brand I hadn't heard about before – and
it's beautiful.

The model is called
["MK1 Caliber"](https://www.timex.com/mk1-40mm-fabric-strap-watch/MK1-40mm-Fabric-Strap-Watch.html?dwvar_MK1-40mm-Fabric-Strap-Watch_color=Black-Black&cgid=mk1#start=1).
Here's why I like this watch:

- **It's super light.** Almost feels like a toy!
- **It has legible typography.** The glass it also functioning as a magnifying glass which enlargens
  the details even further.
- **It shines in the dark.** The hands and numbers, that is. If you press the crown at the side, the
  whole dial lightens up too – a feature I didn't even know until randomly pressing the crown!
- **It's not pricey.** I payed around $100 for this. So much value, for being such an old watch
  company making this.
- **It feels like an everyday watch.** This is no Patek Philippe or some Rolex crap. This is a thing
  _I'll use_ even in rough weather, while skiing or sailing.

The last point might be the most important one: it's bound to be used thanks to its low price and
no-nonsense design. And that's the best feature of it all.
