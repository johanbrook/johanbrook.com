Some thorough work by Nathan Smith (creator of the [960 grid system](http://960.gs)) with the goal
to remove inconsistencies between browsers and platforms. > I want some measure of control over form
elements, without changing them so drastically as to appear foreign in a user’s operating system.
Thus, my quest to find a happy medium, where browsers would generally agree and let me keep my
sanity. The result is what I’m simply referring to as 
[Formalize CSS](http://host.sonspring.com/formalize/). It's some really good work he's done there,
and I'll for sure take a closer look.
