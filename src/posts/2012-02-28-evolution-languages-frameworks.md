> Props to the people who worked hard on Java frameworks who make tons of people happy in the heavy infrastructure enterprise realm, props to the people behind PHP and associated frameworks, props to Rails dev for pushing the envelope and making me enjoy programming again and props to Ryan Dahl, Google and Joyent for making Node happen and shaking the bottle once again.
