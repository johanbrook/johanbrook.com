> Props to the people who worked hard on Java frameworks who make tons of people happy in the heavy
> infrastructure enterprise realm, props to the people behind PHP and associated frameworks, props
> to Rails dev for pushing the envelope and making me enjoy programming again and props to Ryan
> Dahl, Google and Joyent for making Node happen and shaking the bottle once again. The perfect
> framework or language will never be created, and that's why this industry is so exhilarating and
> fun to watch and be a part of.
