Developer [Steve Streza](http://stevestreza.com/) shows us the Twitter client for iOS he's been
building for the last two years (!), but now announces dead. It's got quite an innovative UI, and
mind he began working on it before the real flood of Twitter clients for iPhone came along, and
maybe most important: before Tweetie for iPhone became Twitter for iPhone. Streamlines does not only
show you your Twitter stream: you're able to incorporate Facebook friends as well, and even merge
them together into one. The UI sounds really interesting as Streza chose to avoid the common tab
bars and instead use a "card interface with a horizontal swipe, similar to the iPhone's Weather app
or WebOS' multitasking UI".
