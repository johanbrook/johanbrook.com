Today, most developers (at least web developers) don't write computer science-y stuff all day long.
We solve real world problems, read documentation, build scalable systems, cooperate (social skills
are vital!), implementing other people's code, and more. Quizzes are fine, as long as they are
relevant for the actual work I am going to do.
