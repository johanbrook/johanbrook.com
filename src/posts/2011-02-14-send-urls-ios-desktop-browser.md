Sometimes while browsing the web in Mobile Safari you might find yourself wanting to view the
current site in your desktop browser. We all know it's tedious, boring and plain wrong to type in
the URL from the Mobile Safari window into the desktop browser's address field, so of course someone
has come up with a solution for this. Well, many solutions. I hear from other people that Tapbots'
[Pastebot](http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/) works great, but this means you've got to go
through a third party app. Not everybody want that. So of course there's a quick, hacky and dirty
solution to the problem, which uses nothing but native OS X/iOS technologies and the amazing Dropbox
as always (as well as a free web service). Check out the link above for the complete guide. In
short: connect your Dropbox to the free [Send to Dropbox](http://sendtodropbox.com/) service which
lets you e-mail stuff to your Dropbox account (in this case the web page URL as a text file), and
set up a Automator folder action which runs a Ruby script that opens the text file and put the URL
in your browser window.

    ARGV.each do |f|
       file = File.new(f, "r")

       while (line = file.gets)
          system "open #{line}"
       end

       file.close
    end

It's minimal, hacky and lovely. I'll never stop being amazed over the power of Dropbox and
Automator.
