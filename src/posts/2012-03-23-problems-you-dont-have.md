**Rachel Andrew** on adding bloat and more code in the very beginning of a project, since you _might_ need it. Got to the post via [Roger Johansson's link](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201203/use_only_what_you_need/) titled Use only what you need, which I recommend.  I'm indeed interested in reading about new techniques and ways of setting up new web projects as smooth as possible, but as I've "grown older" I haven't tried out every obscure boilerplate out there. They say Hell is other people's code, and it's indeed true with HTML and CSS. Those technologies are a huge part of what I do, and some frameworks and boilerplates feels awkward to use. It's a different case with backend code libraries, which act like black boxes where you use to interface with something.  **To me, a boilerplate for a project** should be personal and tailored. I've before made the mistake of using my own huge boilerplate which included the latest and greatest HTML5 templates, CSS framework written in SCSS, and some custom Javascript fixes. Everytime I started off a new project I had to change, remove or add stuff. No project is thus the same.  Nowadays I add stuff (polyfills, shims, fixes, Javascript) as I go – when I _need_ it.  I actually don't like Twitter's Bootstrap at all
