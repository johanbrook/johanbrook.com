**Rachel Andrew** on adding bloat and more code in the very beginning of a project, since you
_might_ need it. Got to the post via
[Roger Johansson's link](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201203/use_only_what_you_need/)
titled Use only what you need, which I recommend.

I'm indeed interested in reading about new techniques and ways of setting up new web projects as
smooth as possible, but as I've "grown older" I haven't tried out every obscure boilerplate out
there. They say Hell is other people's code, and it's indeed true with HTML and CSS. Those
technologies are a huge part of what I do, and some frameworks and boilerplates feels awkward to
use. It's a different case with backend code libraries, which act like black boxes where you use to
interface with something.

**To me, a boilerplate for a project** should be personal and tailored. I've before made the mistake
of using my own huge boilerplate which included the latest and greatest HTML5 templates, CSS
framework written in SCSS, and some custom Javascript fixes. Everytime I started off a new project I
had to change, remove or add stuff. No project is thus the same.

Nowadays I add stuff (polyfills, shims, fixes, Javascript) as I go â€“ when I _need_ it.

I actually don't like Twitter's Bootstrap at all
