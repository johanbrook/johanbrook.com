That Tweetie for Mac is getting behind in the desktop Twitter clients for Mac race is a fact
nowadays. Its UI is however phenomenal and I truly hope that Tweetie 2 will be released sometime
soon. In the meantime, check out ReTweetie â€“ a SIMBL plugin which adds Twitter's retweeting
functionality to Tweetie. Great initiative ("if nobody do it, do it yourself").
