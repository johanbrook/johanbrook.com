First time I've thought of a "Slow Web" movement: related to the
[Slow Food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food) equivalent.

I found the author's thoughts on "Rhythm vs. Random" interesting. That's something you could do
yourself: instead of dropping everything you do and answering that e-mail, prepare some time twice a
day to check and answer all the e-mails.

I understand that you lose the instant communication that e-mail involves – but everything isn't
urgent. Some things can wait, like some tweets. Or good food.
