This is my moka pot. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My moka pot is my best
friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my moka pot is
useless. Without my moka pot, I am useless. I must maintain my moka pot thoroughly. I must grind
better than the epsresso machine, who is trying to put us down. I must brew before he brews me. I
will. Before God I swear this creed: my moka pot and myself are defenders of the love for coffee, we
are the masters of espresso, we are the saviors of my tastebuds. So be it, until there is no tea,
but coffee. **Amen**.

I have always been attracted to simple, robust and portable things I can bring on the trip and use
anywhere. My Macbook is one of those things, so is my Victorinox knife, Hagor bag, and Certina wrist
watch. There is something with these kind of objects – you get quite attached to them in a special
way. Is it because of their history or function, or is it because of the simple philosophy behind
their design?

I received a [moka pot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_(coffee_pot) "Moka pot – Wikipedia") from
my uncle for Christmas two years ago. On the card it said: "Sometime you've got to learn" (to drink
coffee, that is). I wasn't into coffee back then, but during my year in Canada I worked at
Starbucks. Funny, huh? Now I'm really a coffee enthusiast and started using my moka pot for real. I
can't love it more than I do.

With only three essential parts, the moka pot is very easy to clean and maintain. Image from
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MokaCoffeePot.svg).

## Design

First, it's the construction of the pot. Its almost-symmetric hour glass design with iconic
octagonal shapes is a joy to study, and even nicer to use. When it's finished brewing and you're
pouring the coffee, a thin, elegant stream of pitch black wonder is coming out of the pipe. By pitch
black, I mean **pitch black**, as coffee should be. The figure to the left describes the different
parts of a moka pot. Essentially, we've got the water chamber (A), the coffee filter (B), and the
coffee chamber (C). Three is a magic number. If you watch the figure you really notice the pot's
symetrical beauty – even on the inside. On the bottom of the coffee chamber (C) there's another
filter with a rubber seal around it, so no steam can get in the chamber but through the grinded
coffee. On one of the water chamber's walls there's a safety valve, which should not be blocked.
Because we're dealing with pressure and steam here, we need a safety valve to release some steam if
the pressure would be too much inside the water chamber. One other thing that really appeals to me
is the material. Mine is made in aluminium with an ABS plastic handle. It's elegant without being to
shiny and uber-modern. To me it speaks sturdiness and "trust me"-ness (very much alike Apple's line
of Macbooks). ![Espresso](http://213.185.255.138/core/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/espresso.png)

## How it works

The principal behind the moka brewing process is quite similar in theory to the espresso machine.
It's not like drip coffee or the french press, where the coffee is sort of steeping in water – moka
pots and espresso machines are working with steam, baby. When the water in the lower chamber is
heated, it'll eventually start boiling. Steam is produced. After a while there will be a lot of
steam in the chamber, and it'll push the remaining water down. The water is forced to go somewhere –
up through the filter pipe, through the coffee and out through the small chimney in the coffee
chamber. It's sort of a simplified espresso machine, but doesn't deal with as high water pressure
though. Thanks to the quick process and pressure involved, more caffeine and flavour is extracted
out of the coffee grounds than with regular drip coffee.

## Philosophy

The moka pot is simply constructed, cheap, easy to use and bring with you – everything an espresso
machine isn't. I'm so fascinated by the simplistic design and I love my moka because of the robust
construction – it's just raw metal with very few small, movable parts. Compare it to an old Volvo
car, or a kalashnikov rifle: both works almost anywhere and has a very rough construction, a very
straight-forward design which is easy to maintain. After usage, just screw it apart and rinse the
parts in warm water, then let dry. The only thing you need with this moka pot (and other coffee
making pots as well) is water, grinded coffee and a heat source.

## How to make it

It's dead simple to make moka coffee. Start with using great dark roast, espresso grinded coffee.
You can buy it anywhere, even your local grocery store. However, to get the best quality, consider a
visit to a coffee or speciality shop.

1. **Put the coffee in the filter (B).** Be quite generous, but do not tamp it! Just shake the
   filter a bit so the coffee is evenly distributed. I can highly recommend mixing some crushed
   cardamom seeds in it. Just a couple is needed. It'll produce a little more tasting coffee, and
   with some cinnamon on the top you're in nirvana.
2. **Fill the water chamber (A)** with cold water up to the security valve
3. **Put the filter on top of the water chamber** (make sure the coffee grounds are where they
   should be – inside the filter) and screw the coffee chamber (C) on top. You don't want any steam
   to leak, so make sure the coffee chamber is really tight.
4. **Put the moka pot on the stove**. It usually takes around 4 minutes for the water to start
   boiling and produce steam. When you're starting to hear the water boiling it's time to pay a bit
   of attention. If you lift the top lid you'll see when the coffee is coming up (like a volcano,
   it's actually quite cool). With my moka pot it usually takes around 30 seconds for the coffee to
   fill the top chamber, but I remove the pot from the heat source before that happens. That's
   because you don't want your coffee diluted with regular water or steam which will start to come
   out of the chimney in the end of the process.
5. **All done!** Enjoy the coffee in small espresso sized cups, in larger cappuccino cups with some
   milk (to really bring out the underlying flavours), or together with steamed milk – latte or
   cappuccino style.

The moka pot is often called "poor man's espresso", because it's way more affordable than a real
espresso machine. However, the coffee you get out of a moka is very similar in strength and taste to
"real" espresso coffee. Almost every home in Italy got a moka pot. An unfair statement would be that
espresso machines are in higher regard becasuse of the skill involved in the process of pulling the
perfect shot of espresso – that these machines only are intended for an elite. Personally, I
actually prefer my moka pot before my father's espresso machine. Even though I've worked in a coffee
shop I find the machine quite tedious to work with, and if you don't pay attention, you might get
really bad tasting espresso (which ruins the whole drink).

## Outro

The ultimate thing would be to make the whole process "by hand". Getting whole espresso beans and
grinding them yourself, heat the water on a wood stove and then steam fresh cow or goat milk. That's
handmade stuff you don't see too much of nowadays, in our fast-paced society. We tend to forget the
quality and freshness of our food. Everything should be able to do anything. The moka pot does one
thing, and it does it well: making great coffee.
