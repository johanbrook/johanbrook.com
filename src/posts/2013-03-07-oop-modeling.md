**When we were doing** our first large programming project (which was an awesome 2D game: 
["Frank the Tank"](http://beta.johanbrook.com/medioqre/)), we went straight ahead with a semi-naïve
approach when doing the initial domain model. As we went on, more models were thrown in in order to
accomodate all possible requirements we had set up. All models were real world things a regular
person could understand ("Player, Enemy, MachineGun", etc.). Later on in the modeling stage we
started to realize things weren't right. We had represented reality in too fine grained detail, and
started to rethink our model from a _computational_ perspective. Thinking in high-level
abstractions, working with sensible inheritance and interfaces, we started to re-implement
everything the way it should be done in a computer game. It worked very well.

Don't adhere to everything the professors in university says. Then you'll hit a brick wall later on,
when you realize the computer's reality isn't a mirror of your own.
