## OS X Lion Developer Preview 1

Yesterday Apple updated us with some info about the next version of the Mac operating system,
[OS X Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/). Lots of UI polishes, with a new default wallpaper
amongst others (as usual with every major OS update). It's a photo of Fuji in shades of pink and
purple and it looks pretty slick.

If anybody would like to use it now, it's available below.

In the Developer Preview 2 of OS X Lion there's a new version of the Fuji wallpaper. Same colours,
but from another perspective with another kind of lighting

I also took the liberty of creating versions for the iPad and iPhone 4:

## OS X Lion Developer Preview 4

On June 6th, the Mac OS X Lion Developer Preview 4 was released to developers, with a brand new
wallpaper. See below. I would personally guess this is the final version, since it sports the space
theme (now the Andromeda galaxy).

## OS X Mountain Lion Developer Preview

On 16 February 2012 Apple released info about the next major update to OS X â€“
[Mountain Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/). It'll arrive as early as the summer of
2012(!), and will bring a number of iOS-esque features to the desktop.

It sports the same space theme as before. Is it the final version already? Naah ..
