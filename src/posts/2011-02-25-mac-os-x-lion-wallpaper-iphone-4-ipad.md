## OS X Lion Developer Preview 1
Yesterday Apple updated us with some info about the next version of the Mac operating system, [OS X Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/). Lots of UI polishes, with a new default wallpaper amongst others (as usual with every major OS update). It's a photo of Fuji in shades of pink and purple and it looks pretty slick.  If anybody would like to use it now, it's available below.  [ ![](http://johanbrook.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fuji.jpg "Download Fuji") ](http://johanbrook.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fuji.jpg)  The Mac OS X Lion Developer Preview wallpaper
## OS X Lion Developer Preview 2
In the Developer Preview 2 of OS X Lion there's a new version of the Fuji wallpaper. Same colours, but from another perspective with another kind of lighting [[Source]](http://osxdaily.com/2011/04/02/new-mt-fuji-wallpaper-in-mac-os-x-lion-developer-preview-2/). Available below:  [ ![](http://johanbrook.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fuji-2.jpg "Download Fuji 2") ](http://johanbrook.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fuji-2.jpg)  The Mac OS X Lion Developer Preview 2 wallpaper  I also took the liberty of creating versions for the iPad and iPhone 4:

## OS X Lion Developer Preview 4
On June 6th, the Mac OS X Lion Developer Preview 4 was released to developers, with a brand new wallpaper. See below. I would personally guess this is the final version, since it sports the space theme (now the Andromeda galaxy).  [ ![](http://johanbrook.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Andromeda-Wallpaper.jpg "Download Andromeda Wallpaper") ](http://johanbrook.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Andromeda-Wallpaper.jpg)  The Mac OS X Lion Developer Preview 4 wallpaper
## OS X Mountain Lion Developer Preview
On 16 February 2012 Apple released info about the next major update to OS X – [Mountain Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/). It'll arrive as early as the summer of 2012(!), and will bring a number of iOS-esque features to the desktop.   It sports the same space theme as before. Is it the final version already? Naah ..   [ ![Mountain Lion wallpaper](http://f.cl.ly/items/2d1i142X0S191l2s3r3r/Mountain%20Lion.jpg) ](http://f.cl.ly/items/2d1i142X0S191l2s3r3r/Mountain%20Lion.jpg)The Mountain Lion wallpaper
