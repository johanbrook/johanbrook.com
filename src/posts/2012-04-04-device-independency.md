**One thing hit me the other day. **I’ve written about
[sync between devices before](http://johanbrook.com/the-internet/sync-safety/ "Sync is about safety"),
and now I thought about the actual physical move between them. It has sneaked up on me recently: how
we use multiple devices more frequently these days. What’s interesting is how the software inside
adapts to it.

What I mean is how you are able to use Messages on a Mac on your desk, then suddenly decide to move
over to Messages the iPad in the couch. Got to run? Bring your iPhone along. What’s cool is the fact
that you’re able to _continue the conversation from wherever you left off, on any of these devices_.

Most social media services that have apps for the three big markets (desktop, tablet, mobile) are
doing the same thing. It’s not over after closing Facebook or Twitter on your computer – carry on
what you were doing from your phone instead 1. Services like iCloud and Dropbox make it incredibly
easy to switch between devices. Apple’s iBooks is available only for the iPhone and iPad, but still
manage to create a “begin where you left off” feeling, thanks to the syncing of bookmarks. The Music
app, along with iTunes on the desktop, is cool since I’m able to continue listening on a podcast on
my iPad right where I left off. Instapaper is a prime example as well.

You could call it **device independency**, since the content doesn’t depend on a certain device in
order to function or show properly. I find it really cool to see apps and web sites just magically
_adapt_ to a different device and still let me access the content. The otherwise hard lines between
devices are starting to blur out when it comes to content.

**When building stuff,** in my case websites, I think it’s important to have this in mind when doing
responsive design. How people move between devices, and what users want to do with the website on
each device. This is getting important since we've got more and more devices (and screen sizes!) to
build for.

When true device independency is achieved, it’s really a tremendous joy to use a product. Let me
float smoothly and seamlessly between devices while using your product, and I'll be happy.

1. However, many timeline based services as Twitter still have to fix the “begin where I left off”
   issue – to sync the last read item when switching devices. [Tweetmarker](http://tweetmarker.net/)
   has solved this for tweets.
