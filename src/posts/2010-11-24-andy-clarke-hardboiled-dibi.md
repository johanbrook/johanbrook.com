> Most of the time we're not heroes at all, most of the time we just whine about what we **can't**
> do, rather than what we **can** do. Clarke's talk about his brand new book on advanced CSS3
> techniques: [Hardboiled Web Design](http://hardboiledwebdesign.com). I also recommend
> the accompanying  [slides](http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/talk/).
