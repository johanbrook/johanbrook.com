Dmitry Fadeyev:

> His [Ive's] latest designs are a tribute to Dieter Rams, who sought to produce the timeless through ruthless, methodical elimination. Rams approach produced work that was clean, simple and could stand the test of time because it was not a work of style but his best solution to the given problem.
Call me a boring northern European, but I like the clean, simple, functional industrial designs of Braun, Apple, IKEA, et al.
