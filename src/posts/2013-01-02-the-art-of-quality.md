> Quality should not be confused with perfection though. A good example is the Japanese “Ensō”, a
> form of minimalist expressionist art in the shape of a circle. Some artists paint ensō with an
> opening in the circle to symbolize that imperfection is an essential and inherent aspect of
> existence.
