**Wordpress 3.1 brought us** a lot of things; an admin bar amongst others. That one's been present
on hosted Wordpress.com blogs for quite some time, and available as a plugin as well. At first I
deactivated the bar at once, but later I realized it's pretty handy to have around. I usually make
my own admin menus for quick access to stats, new posts and more, but the official admin bar is more
versatile (I'm using the Wordpress function `current_user_can("manage_options")` in an if-statement
to show the admin menu only to me).

Anyway, how about customizing the admin bar? You know: add stuff, style stuff. Plugins and themes
may add their own menus to the bar, as with the Wordpress.com Stats plugin I'm using, for instance.
A small graph is shown in the bar if you've got the plugin installed, with a link to the admin stats
page. Neat – as you see on the screenshot above it also shows the shortlink to the current
page/post. The rendering of the bar itself builds upon a simple API you can hook into, but I haven't
found any documentation in the Wordpress Codex yet though, so I'm gonna show some simple examples
from what I've picked up from the Wordpress core. First we need a hook. The Wordpress developers
advise us to use `admin_bar_menu` . Right on. Add this to `functions.php` :

    add_action("admin_bar_menu", "customize_menu");

    function customize_menu(){
        global $wp_admin_bar;

        // Do stuff
    }

The `customize_menu()` is a handler which will do stuff with the admin bar. We also need to define
the global `$wp_admin_bar` variable in order to call the API functions.

## The API

The WP\_Admin\_Bar class includes the great `add_menu()` function which we use to add menus:

    $wp_admin_bar->add_menu($args);

    // Defaults:
    $args = array(
       "id" => false,
       "title" => false,
       "href" => false,
       "parent" => false,
       "meta" => false
    );

`id` (String) The id of your menu. Make sure it's unique – this will identify your menu, and also be
used in the menu item's `id` attribute in the HTML code like this:
`<li id="wp-admin-bar-{$id}"> ... </li>` `title` (String) The title of your menu. Will be shown on
the front-end. `href` (String) The URL the menu post links to. `parent` (String) The id of the
parent menu, if you'd want that. `meta` (Array) Some handy extra stuff: "html", "class", "onclick",
"title" and "target". Ex: `"meta" => array("onclick" => 'alert("Hi there");')` . Note: the value of
"html" will be added directly after your menu item in the bar. So with these guys you could
construct something like this:

    $wp_admin_bar->add_menu(array(
       "id" => "mymenu",
       "title" => "A custom menu",
       "href" => "http://google.com",
       "meta" => array("target" => "blank")
    ));

... which will produce this:

Neat. Now you have a custom, top-level menu item. What if you'd like to link to pages in the
Wordpress admin from your menu? Check out the `admin_url()` function. Use it to link directly to any
page in wp-admin, like this: `admin_url("nav-menus.php")` . Incredibly good for plugin authors.

## Dropdown menus

A menu item is cool and all, but it would be awesome to add more items and group them, like in a
dropdown menu. We'll go ahead and to that with the `parent` key in the argument array. Add this
below the previous code:

    $wp_admin_bar->add_menu(array(
    	"id" => "my-child-menu",
    	"title" => "Child",
    	"parent" => "mymenu"
    ));

It behaves just like any other menu, but you'll have to specify the `parent` key to the top-level
menu's id. The children are automatically attached to the parent menu and shown on hover, as
expected:

## External data

So now it's completely up to your needs. Just use functions and variables as usual as you du in
`functions.php` . For instance, just declare the global `$post` variable beside `$wp_admin_bar` and
you'll have access to the current post's data:

    add_action("admin_bar_menu", "customize_menu");

    function customize_menu(){
    	global $wp_admin_bar, $post;

    	$children = get_children(array("post_parent" => $post->ID));

    	$wp_admin_bar->add_menu(array(
    		"id" => "mymenu",
    		"title" => "Post: " . $post->post_title,
    		"href" => "http://google.com",
    		"meta" => array("target" => 'blank')
    	));

    	if($children){
    		foreach($children as $c){
    			$wp_admin_bar->add_menu(array(
    				"parent" => "mymenu",
    				"title" => $c->post_title,
    				"href" => get_permalink($c->ID)
    			));
    		}
    	}

    }

Simple enough: _get access to `$post` => Find eventual child pages => loop through and add to parent
item._

## Source

You'll find relevant source code in the files `wp-includes/class-wp-admin-bar.php` and
`wp-includes/admin-bar.php` . Funny: I just realized I had switched to Chrome for the last two
screenshots. You'll just have to put up with that.
