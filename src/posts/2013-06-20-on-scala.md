A friend and colleague of mine is boasting a lot about [Clojure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) and it's productive capabilities. But I really can't wrap my head around the LISP syntax. Perhaps it's a matter of putting in time.   If one want to stay on the awesome JVM with its performance, [Scala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala) is worth checking out. It's the language which is said to fuse functional and object-oriented programming in a great package. Read the linked article, "On Scala", for a nice walkthrough.
