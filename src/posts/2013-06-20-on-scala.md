A friend and colleague of mine is boasting a lot about
[Clojure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) and it's productive capabilities. But I really can't
wrap my head around the LISP syntax. Perhaps it's a matter of putting in time.

If one want to stay on the awesome JVM with its performance,
[Scala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala) is worth checking out. It's the language which is said
to fuse functional and object-oriented programming in a great package. Read the linked article, "On
Scala", for a nice walkthrough.
