The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming
languages they know, and it’s not whether they prefer Python or Java. It’s whether they can
communicate their ideas. By writing clear comments and technical specs, they let other programmers
understand their code, which means other programmers can use and work with their code instead of
rewriting it. Absent this, their code is worthless. By writing clear technical documentation for end
users, they allow people to figure out what their code is supposed to do, which is the only way
those users can see the value in their code. Joel Spolsky
