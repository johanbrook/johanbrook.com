> The students that are successful look at that challenge, wrestle with feelings of inadequacy and
> stupidity, and begin to take steps hiking that mountain, knowing that bruised pride is a small
> price to pay for getting to see the view from the top. They ask for help, they acknowledge their
> inadequacies. They don't blame their lack of intelligence, they blame their lack of motivation.
> Great text from an MIT grad about the challenges and feelings during his freshman year at MIT.
> Many wise quotes.
