Really great article on the state of RSS. I've seen many posts claiming "RSS is dead", but to me it's absolutely not dead â€“ the technology is everywhere on the web! It's built in inside every major blog system, CMS, web framework and web app. That's not a dead technology. The problem is, as the article puts it, that RSS hasn't received the widespread user base it deserves. It's being ignored, and failed by browser vendors and others.

> We lose the ability for websites to push updates to us on their own terms and infrastructure, rather than through closed APIs and flavour-of-the-month platforms.
Read the article. I especially love the author's brainstorming about possible browser features built with RSS. I've had a post about RSS in this article's style in my head since last summer (was gonna name it "RSS Is Not Dead") but this one nails it.
