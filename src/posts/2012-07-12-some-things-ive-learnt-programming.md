> To my mind that's a craft. I think the best programmers are closer to watchmakers than bridge
> builders or physicists. Sure, it looks like it's science or engineering because of the application
> of logic and mathematics, but at its core it's taking tools in your hands (almost) and crafting
> something. So many gems in there.
