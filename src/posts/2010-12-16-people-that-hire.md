[Mitch Bartlett](http://mbartlett.me/) has written a very thoughtful, honest and true piece about
and to people who initiates projects with freelancers but then, well, screws them over in the end.
Please read. If you're "the hiring guy" â€“ don't be that bad person who act this way when dealing
with craftsmen. Pay for the work and don't be a cheap-o.
