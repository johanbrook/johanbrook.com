Gruber just posted a link to an interview of Ryan Singer from 37signals, where Singer mentioned a
mobile HTML5 framework. That's pretty big stuff – Ruby on Rails is doing pretty good, and a mobile
framework in the same style would be quite awesome, since it according to Singer uses Coffeescript –
a way more human friendly, Ruby like style of writing Javascript (a programmer friend of mine is
totally in love with it). We've got a lot of Javascript frameworks for mobile devices these days.
The first one I got in touch with (no pun intended, promise) was [jQTouch](http://jqtouch.com/) – a
simple and stylish jQuery framework mainly for iOS. That one evolved into
[Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) (now based on Ext.js), and the jQuery group
themselves recently released [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) with support for a lot of
phones and operating systems. Two more heavy-weight guys are
[Sproutcore](http://www.sproutcore.com/) and [Cappuccino](http://cappuccino.org/). Isn't the market
over-saturated soon? Will this mobile framework by 37signals become just one in a million, or might
it be "the one"? Before everybody go nuts, it's worth noting that
[Sam Stephenson](http://twitter.com/sstephenson) (37signals, creator of Prototype.js) stated this in
a comment on the interview:

> Hey folks, there's nothing to see here right now. We spent three weeks experimenting with some new
> tech to see what we could build, and ended up with something that looks a bit like Rails, but
> entirely client-side and written in CoffeeScript. The project driving the framework—an HTML5
> mobile UI for Basecamp—has been on hold for about a month now, and we're still a ways off from
> having anything to show. It just isn't a priority for us right now. When (or if) we do have
> something we'll be sure to post about it on our blog. That is, it's not a silver bullet from
> 37signals for writing mobile apps (yet). It's very, very interesting – yes – but nothing to start
> drooling over (yet). Personally, I'm in agony, since I've got another framework to put on my
> "Learn/Have A Closer Look At" list. **Update, April 15th 2011:** turned out the framework
> 37signals was experimenting with was indeed
> [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) – an open source Javascript library which
> helps you structure your code in JS-heavy applications according to the MVC pattern (
> [source](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#examples-basecamp)).
