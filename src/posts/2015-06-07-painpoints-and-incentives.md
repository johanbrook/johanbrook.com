**When working with building features in a product**, I usually need some emotional attachment to them. You can't make them good unless you believe in them and really *understand the problem you're trying to solve*. This is of course Johan-stating-the-obvious, but I experienced this the other day.

Our CEO at [Lookback](http://lookback.io), [Jonatan](http://twitter.com/littke), once said that he had heard from Slack that their success largely depended on that everyone in their team really understood the product. By understanding the product, I refer to the problems it tries to solve. By "problems", I mean real pain points. 

It's easy to mindlessly build features by taking cards out of the backlog – rinse and repeat. But they'll only be *so* good – in order for features to achieve their fullest potential, its creators must be given the freedom to explore different routes, but also they need *empathy*. 

Two stories:

## Feeling the users

Me and Jonatan visited some Silicon Valley companies the other day, where we did some lightweight user testing and interviews centering around [Lookback's new player](https://lookback.io/watch/rWcyfETYu8vsrYpAY). The player is the creation of our awesome designer [Tobias](http://twitter.com/tobiasahlin) and myself. Tobias had taken part of customer meetings beforehand, so he had witnessed their pain points up front with his eyes. I was sitting around on the west coast of Sweden, always taking on the newest design mocks from Tobias. When *I* visited the before mentioned customers in the valley, it was the first time I'd seen a customer interacting with our product – with the player I built. It was an enlightening experience, since I felt: *"Wow, we really need to fix [this]"* or *"Shit, we should totally go in [this] direction!"*. 

It reminded me of what's important with our product, and that's a thing a remote chat never can express. I felt empathy when we met our contacts at the company, when they described their workflow and mentioned things like *"Yeah, it would be cool to do [this] in the player"* or described a bug. I instantly wanted to make it up do them somehow, since I was emotionally invested in their workflow now.

## Making it *your* feature

When you're solving a thing for yourself – your own sake – it'll probably be a good creation. You know what you want, and create it: a one-to-one relationship between incentive and outcome.

A user experience researcher from Quora – who's an avid Lookback user – requested a way to transcribe comments from a Lookback recording. That is, somehow export comments made while watching a user test. When I heard about it, I thought *"Yeah, that'd be cool, but ..."* and then I put it on a mental to do somewhere and forgot about it. When I last week experienced that very need for the feature, it was another scenario: I immediately started to think of the implementation, interface, and usage of exporting comments to Markdown or similar. I immediately created a card in Trello. See the difference? I had made it *my* feature since it filled *my* need. 

***

This is of course common knowledge, but I nevertheless think it's something that's easy to forget. Building products for people involves actually interacting and understanding them and their needs, before you decide what to build.
