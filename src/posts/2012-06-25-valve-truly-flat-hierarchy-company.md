> One study, by researchers at the University of Iowa and Texas A&M University, found that teams of factory workers who supervised themselves tended to outperform workers in more traditional hierarchies, so long as team members got along well.
Interesting story about how flat company Valve really is. I've heard about it's modern thinking about management, but didn't think it was this flat. It could either go super good or really bad (as we know, it's the former) – it feels like an experiment similar to "The Animal Farm" or something.
