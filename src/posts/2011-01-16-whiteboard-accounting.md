Frank Chimero shares a quite cool idea about how to get an overview of your income as a freelancer,
which could help you realize you actually can say no to certain projects. I really think the visual
is most important â€“ when you have it written on a huge whiteboard you see it from another
perspective. It becomes sort of a way of restraining yourself from getting too money-hungry and
accept boring jobs. Go read the post, it's a bright idea.
