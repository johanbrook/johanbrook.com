Andrey Petrov:

Twitter is the Benjamin Button of startups.

Born out of wisdom and insight in our daily social behaviour, completely changing the way we
communicate. Soon grown into a heroic Atlas, holding up the world of third-party developers on its
shoulders, thriving as the platform rises along with thousands of apps and services transforming the
experience. Dusk approaches when Twitter sheds its desire to leave a mark on humanity and finds
itself destined to die as a single-feature web-based MVP. A sparkle in a developer's eye.

Interesting thought. I find it sad that Twitter has become the thing it's become. Anti 3rd party,
strict API rules, sell-out ads business model, etc. etc. Not the small, fun and loving startup it
once was.

I guess it's _"You either die as a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the
villain"_.
