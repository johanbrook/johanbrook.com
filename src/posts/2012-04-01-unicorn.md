[Sacha Greif](http://thenextweb.com/author/sachagreif/) – The Next Web, 2012 Follow the linked
article above and read about why startups today can't find decent designers. Further down the
article I think the author pinpoints two issues:

- Companies want "unicorn designers/developers", "ninjas", or "rockstars", or _&lt;insert corny
  brogrammer term here&gt;_.
- Their demands are set too high. Let younger guys and girls in.

**There are two sides of the designer-developer hybrid part.** In the web world front-end code and
design are so close together these days, and I think it's wrong and a mistake to focus on only one
of those two. Sure: you could get by, but wouldn't it be boring not to be able to implement your own
designs? Or never be able to create something nice for your own without, say Twitter's Bootstrap?

In the native world where the "front-end" code generally is a bit heavier and hard-core, I can see
how designers really are designers, and developers are developers (if you can do both: awesome!).
Personally I think it's easier to do both code and design in the web world.

The article says there are few "unicorn" designers/developers, e.g. hybrids. For me it's a matter of
interest and a never ending thirst of knowledge: I want to learn advanced Javascript patterns as I
read about typography and grid techniques.

Unicorns **do** exist! How to become one? Never stop moving. If you are one? Consider yourself
lucky, and start choosing your next employer with care.
