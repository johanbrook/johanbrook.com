So I redesigned my site. It's close to one year since
[my last post](/writings/writing-contextual-css/), and I actually feel itchy to write things again
(mostly for my own sake).

I wanted a small place online which could act as my "home". A thing I want to take care of, update,
and iterate on. Much has happened in my life, and that wasn't reflected in the past site.

I've "worked" on this site since last August (_"And all you could do was this?!"_), and built it
with [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/). The source is at
[GitHub](https://github.com/johanbrook/johanbrook.com) if you're interested. I also managed to fix
one of these [RSS feeds](http://www.johanbrook.com/rss.xml) if you wanna subscribe.

Cheerio!
