[![](http://kodapp.com/screenshot.png "Kod app")](http://groups.google.com/group/kod-app/browse_thread/thread/8bc80d18932f5e99)
[Kod app](http://kodapp.com/) is a promising code editor for OS X, created by the Swede (wohoo!)
Rasmus Andersson. A bunch of features are promised, and the big news is that Rasmus today announced
the projectÂ  [open sourced at Github](https://github.com/rsms/kod). Great stuff. There's also a
[beta](http://kodapp.com/download) out if you want to try it out. I think it's awesome with a new
simple, light-weight editor that's actually maintained. If Kod gets versatile, flexible, great
features and highly customizable, I think we've got a player.
