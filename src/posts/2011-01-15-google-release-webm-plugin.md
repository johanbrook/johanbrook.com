> [Clarified that the Safari and IE9 plug-ins to be released by the WebM Project Team enable WebM playback via the HTML standard &lt;video&gt; tag canPlayType interface and not an alternate non-standard method.](http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/more-about-chrome-html-video-codec.html)

Are Google serious? They're now talking about this WebM plugin for browser that doesn't support it
out of the box. As TechCrunch put it: "So much for web standard". In my world, web standards make
your browser ready to go to surf the web – all batteries included. The battle against Flash was
useless if another plugin will be required to play half of the web's video. You neither can nor
should call a plugin "a standard". Dangerous move, Google, but you'll probably get away with it. As
usual.
