![Rue]({{ "euphoria.jpg" | postAssetUrl }})

[Euphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series) on HBO is my new favourite
series. Even though my experience with the American teenage upbringing is non-existent, the show is
very realistic and well made. It's like [Skam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skam_(TV_series)) but
with heavier drugs and … heavier of everything.

I especially like the cinematography and fast paced storytelling. You get sucked in pretty easily.
The main character, Rue, is portrayed perfectly. I find it interesting how they don't romanticise
youth, as other shows are doing. This show is _dark_ – be prepared – it's not this _"Youth is wasted
on the young"_ thing. More like _"I'm glad you're still alive, carrying all this shit around_".
