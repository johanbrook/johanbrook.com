Maven Pro is a free sans serif font designed by Joe Prince. It currently consists of a single
weight, but the creators promises more to come. I think it looks incredibly slick and fine tuned.
You're free to donate: all proceeds go to charity. _(However, the site doesn't say wether the font
is okay to use in web design as a @font-face__)_ **Update:** After reading the ReadMe it clearly
states it's okay to embed the font with @font-face: > This font CAN be used with @font-face and the
web font files are included, enjoy! EOT, SVG, WOFF and TTF are included, as well as the regular OTF
font file. Awesomeness.
