[ ![Git Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/img/screenshots/history_list_big.jpg "Git Tower") ](http://www.git-tower.com/) Tower is an upcoming Mac client for the Git versioning system, and it looks good. I'm still a noob on Git, so I guess I would find it very useful, and maybe even power users in large projects would too. Anyhow I think it's great that it exists a native client for Mac – like [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) for MySQL databases. Choice is good. The command line doesn't always cut it, and web based is ... yeah, web based. It doesn't say if it's paid or free, but the developers are on Twitter ( [@gittower](http://twitter.com/gittower)), and Tower is coming this November.
