[Thomas Fuchs](http://twitter.com/thomasfuchs) gives us a tip about viewing which elements of a
website are powered by the device's hardware. I've never ever heard of this before, but I'd bet it's
useful. The hardware accelerated areas show up in semi-transparent red. To use the feature, simply
open up a Terminal prompt and write:

    $ CA_COLOR_OPAQUE=1 /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari

Also possible to achieve in the iPhone Simulator.
