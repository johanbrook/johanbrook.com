After a complete rewrite during the weekend, my barebones starter theme for Wordpress is up at GitHub. It provides a basic HTML5 structure with partials, lots of handy helper functions, and a couple of setup configurations. Check out the ReadMe and try it out. It evolved from my own habits when creating Wordpress sites, so the GitHub repo also serves as a great location to store the files and access them from anywhere. It's only a skeleton, so no styling is included [(check out my Sass framework for that)](https://github.com/johanbrook/dyluni). Frequently used Javascript libraries are included though, as well as a suggestion on a .htaccess file.
