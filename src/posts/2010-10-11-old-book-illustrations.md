I've really got a thing for clean typographic blogs with seemingly custom illustrations in them. Above is a great collection of vintage woodcuts and engravings, scanned and released for public use. That is, you can download them and use completely free in both personal and commercial projects. I think that's wonderful, and if your more interested there's a [Terms of Service](http://www.oldbookillustrations.com/pages/terms-of-use.php?lng=en) provided:

> You may use our pictures in your school projects, to make CD sleeves, posters, banners or any part of a website, in animations, etc - anything where you have added your own artistic effort, be that for educational, personal or commercial use. No credit is required in this case.
This is how it's done.
