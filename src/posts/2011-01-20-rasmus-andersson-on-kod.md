![](http://kodapp.com/icon-256.png "Kod") [Rasmus Andersson](http://hunch.se) who's currently
developing the [code editor Kod](http://kodapp.com/) is telling us a little bit about how he came up
with the idea, and why. I really like the spirit and goals of the project. The upcoming syntax
highlighting and plugin features appeals a lot to me, as well as the clever address field in the
app, which lets you edit any text file you know the URL for â€“ local or remote. Textmate is great,
but it's not that maintained and up-to-date. A lightweight, customizable, community developed code
editor like Kod would help a lot. Go check out [Kod's Github page](http://github.com/rsms/kod) and
see if there's anything you can do.
