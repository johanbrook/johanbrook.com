![](http://www.creativereview.co.uk/images/uploads/2010/12/mentalgassiaistreet_0.jpg "Face") Amnesty usually pulls off pretty cool campaigns in the public, and this one is not an exception. To raise awareness of Troy Davis, a man who has been on the death row for nineteen years and always pledged not guilty, the agency created a concept similar to those small cards you made when you were little. Thin stripes are attached to regular bars, and viewed from the right angle, Davis' face becomes visible. It makes the invisible visible.
