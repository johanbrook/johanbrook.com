      says on the back. I like the author's writing in the way that it's very on point. Like the world he's created,

      I've finished the final installment of Knausgård's _Min Kamp_ (_My Struggle_) autobiographical series. The full

      _Min Kamp_ is an epic amount of work. It retells Knausgård's childhood, adolescence, university years, and
      eventually becoming a father — this is over four decades of memories he accounts of in excruciating detail. This
      pioneering style of writing, and of course the fact that he writes about real people without changing too many
      names, was what made these novels unique.

      I feel I can't accurately describe how I feel about the series, since English not being my mothertongue. I can only
      praise the level of _detail and honesty_ that has gone into the pages. I am no writer, but I appreciate honesty in
      texts. Also have been a boy, teenager, a young adult, and now a father myself, I identify with areas and scenes
      brought up over the six volumes, each describing encompassing chunks of Knausgård's life.

      What's problematic, of course, with _Min Kamp_ is that he writes about people being close to him, and since he's
      being honest, it's not always positive things. His father, mother, brother, his then-wife, old girlfriends, old
      colleagues are described in the way Knausgård sees them. It's _his_ voice, _his_ views. But he had to do it,
      according to himself, in order to stay honest to the project.

      What I'm most touched and deeply affected by in the end, is his and his then-wife Linda Boström Knausgård's story. It begins in the late 90s, and describes their relationship from being lovers in Stockholm to being a family with
      three kids on the countryside of Skåne in south Sweden. He writes how Linda suffers from being bipolar,
      which climaxes at the end of the sixth volume. It's almost like they became fictional figures for me, since I
      wanted it to work out for them _so much_ I forgot they're real people (they separated in 2016. _Sob_). Their years
      together are described with such intimacy, which I think is required in order to make it honest and real. It made
      me so empathetic towards both of them. The whole situation: Knausgårds need to write, Linda's mental condition,
      their kids, their everyday life. I find myself being happy for them in the light moments, and sad in the dark
      periods. They become real, because they _are_ real.

      Knausgård shows that every person's life is indeed "interesting" and is a well of experiences from which you can draw stories from. Even though he admits later that he wouldn't have done the project if he knew the
      costs, I'm personally happy that he did, since it's a remarkable piece of work. Does he fully portray his wife
      Linda's authentic inner self? No. Is it right to write about his dead father and grandmother in the way he does?
      Maybe, maybe not.

      I've read quite many opinions about the series, and it's what you'd expect: much praise, but a lot of analysis
      going on about ethics, chauvinism, and self-centerism (is that a word?). In the end, I was entertained and adore
      Karl Ove Knausgård's style and angle.

      I liked "Nattens Skola", and became quite immersed in it.

      This is the fourth installment of Knausgård's "Morgonstjärnan" series. It's hard to say if it's a different universe from the other three books. The style is what Knausgård does best, but "Nattens Skola" contains more twists and turns than usual, and the main character is not that sympathetic at all, which is spelled out for us in the text quite early.

      I tend to appreciate novels where there's a jump in time. I love to see the passing of time and how the author treats it with their characters. Here, the first part is in the 1980s, and the second part is 20 years later (the first part has been given the most space). It was also quite refreshing to put it in London instead of Norway.

      In the other books, I had an easier time keeping up with the purpose of the text, whereas in this one, I constantly tried to look for underlying patterns (deeper than the obvious Faustian theme). Maybe I need to read some analytical texts from people smarter than me. Or, it's just "less grand" by design than book number one and three, in the way that there's less of the apocalyptical end-of-days vibe.

      Further, all but one character from the protagonist's time in London in the 80s were discarded. One part of me appreciates that "technique", where I as a reader shouldn't expect random people from the past coming back to the main character — this isn't how real life is anyway. So I was probably coloured by that sensational expectation that something like that would happen. In the end, Knausgård is superb at describing everyday interactions between people, which assembles the book's universe, so that's always a joy in itself.

      After reading mr. Knausgård's pieces for months, I felt a need for reading something by mrs. Boström Knausgård.

      Her prose is beautiful and honest. The book describes her time at a psychiatric ward, where she's going through electric shock treatment, which is a horrible way to "cure" bipolar disorder. Further, she retells fragments from her youth and marriage to Karl Ove Knausgård (where he's the "you" in the text).

      It's a very vulnerable text, dripping of anger towards the system in Sweden, and sadness over the detoriation of her marriage and subsequent divorce. Both subjects hurt to read in different ways.

      There's no way getting away from that there's a darkness laid over the whole text, and I put it down with a stint of melancholia but also empathy towards Linda Boström Knausgård. After it was over, I just wanted her to be happy.

      This novel's prose was fantastic to read. It captures the (chaotic?) inner life of a millennial woman in her late 20s. The stream of consciousness style thoughts are amazingly written, because of how they picture a myriad of _things_ bombarding the main character, like everything from Tinder to ads. Her observations, which frankly are quite objective, of contemporary *bourgeoisie* people around her, are perfectly captured. The text makes couple's dinners feel so fake and messed up.

      I was late to this, but nevertheless I loved reading it. The author's write-as-you-think style is very entertaining and never annoying (sometimes, the prose can get _too_ sloppy). I totally understand that this piece became the eye opening text when it was first released, which told the world How It Really Was in the restaurant business.

      I applaud the author's calls for grit and perseverance when it comes to pursuing a career in cooking. But the clearly toxic elements in the workplace has to go (I hope it's better these days). He also points out — often implicitly but sometimes explicitly — how much the industry relies on immigrants. Salvadorians, Equadorians, Mexicans, etc. And they _work their asses off_ for peanuts. This quote is on point:

      After having watched [_Ripley_](/micro/20240516112200/), I felt I needed _more_ Ripley. This original book by Patricia Highsmith totally offered what I was looking for. The film _The Talented Mr. Ripley_ with Matt Damon and Jude Law only seemingly scratched the surface of Ripley's character: his story felt too fast and hastily told in that film, wheareas the _Ripley_ series gave him much more space. In the book, we can finally follow his own thoughts in third person.

      Highsmith's prose in the novel is, what I guess, super modern for being from the 1950s. Also, in everything Ripley says or does, she manages the balance perfectly between "normal sensitive person" and "psychotic killer". Meaning, she makes us believe that Ripley totally thinks his actions and thoughts are _legitimate_, but not in an absurd, sick way: his disturbing thoughts are always toned down and subtle.

      I enjoyed _The Talented Mr. Ripley_ a lot, especially paired with the tv series _Ripley_.

      This was an interesting piece of work: it's a historical piece but focused on the author's own female family tree in South Africa, ever since the first Dutch settlers arrived in the 1650s. The author has gone through old archives of letters and documentation of select women. She's tracked her heritage from a native Khoisan woman named Krotoa, all the way through intermarriages with the Dutch, through the wife of prime minister Jan Smuts, down to her aunt in present day. It was a super fascinating read, and to put it bluntly: it made "history come alive".

      Woman by woman through history, the author retells a quite vivid picture of some key events, but also every day things. What's clear early (in the forewords) is that the author is 150% on to the idea of "checking her privilege", both when it comes to her whiteness in South Africa, and also because of her relations to the former prime minsiter Jan Smuts. Smuts has been regarded as a national hero in South Africa, and later a grand figure in both world wars. He was promoted to Field Marshall in the UK, and was instrumental in forming both the League of Nations and the United Nations. But, as the author constantly is reminding us of, he was also instrumental in taking the first steps towards apartheid. Lately, he image has been twisted, since in modern eyes, he was quite frankly a good old white supremacist.

      The author goes a long way to remind us of this _colonial guilt_ of her and all white people in South Africa. After a while I felt something like "alright, I get it". But it's a small price to pay: to be constantly reminded of it in a historical book like this.

      This was a classic "comfort read". A middle aged dad brings his family of a wife and two adolescent kids to the French countryside (in Languedoc, nota bene, and not in the oh so popular French Riviera or Provence).

      The book read like a travel log and memoir, and I liked the intimate writing without dropping the rhythm in the story. It was *quite* foreseeable though: how many movies and books aren't there about an American coming to either the Spanish, French, or Italian countryside and learns what's really important in life? It *might* come off as a bit pretentious, if looking at the book from a certain angle.

      Nevertheless, it was — as mentioned — a read that will make you want to go to France, if you didn't want it already. The author spends a lot of time on the topics of wine making and cooking (he's a food writer too, as it turns out, after me googling), which are enjoyable.

      Another history book about South Africa. This focused on recent events at the time of the book's writing: in 1990. Thanks to that, much of the interviews and stories felt *fresh*, as in, the author had just heard or witnessed these things and wrote them down. Note that this was before Nelson Mandela was released and apartheid was deconstructed. For me, reading a book about a racist, authoritarian, police state *while it's still going on*, was a totally new thing (the book included an epilogue written in the late 2000s too).

      The author intelligently jumped between events in the 1830s and present time in the 1980s. The backbone was The Great Treak: the move of thousands of white Dutch descendants from the Western Cape area to north east South Africa due to dissatisfaction with the British abolition of slavery, amongst other things. This journey became a national myth during apartheid.

      *The Mirror at Midnight* had a lot of interviews and anecdotes with anti-apartheid activists, as well as "the other side": the white Afrikaners enforcing the regime's orders. I've read a few detailed texts about life in Eastern Germany during the Cold War, and the similarities are striking. South Africa truly was a horrible police state, with all that entails (fake trials, torture, forced evictions, informer networks, and so on).

      What makes me wonder while reading it is "what are these white people doing today?". Much of the old guard have died out, but all the police officers, mining bosses, and farm owners who brutally assaulted the black population: how do they live now in the South African society? While the country still is heavily segregated, its constitution gives all races the freedom of a modern democracy. I'd appreciate reading interviews with the white people living during apartheid and how they see life now, having to "share" society with blacks — even be ruled by them!

      It would be simple to try to compare this one with [*Moederland*](/reading/moederland), since both treats the highly problematic story of South Africa's past. *Moederland* went further back in history, treating individual women's stories. I preferred *The Mirror at Midnight* as a piece of work however: it was drier and managed to move me more than the sentimental, guilt ridden stories in *Moederland*.

      South Africa continues to fascinate me enormously.

      I usually enjoy short story collections, and I did enjoy this one too. The author surgically describes a range of characters — often misfits — who often appears in each others' stories. It's very raw and "vulgar": nothing is left for the imagination, so to speak. And it's amazing. I was especially touched by all the references to internet culture in the 2000s-2010s in one story. It's a lot of negativity and dark bits, kinda like _A Little Life_, but not that extreme. I felt a bit weird _enjoying_ reading about the characters' meander deep into the abyss, but what the hell.

      First book by South African author J.M. Coetzee I've read, appropriately while I'm in South Africa too. It tells the story about a university professor in Cape Town in the late 1990s who gets fired for having an affair with a student. He then moves to his daughter's farm in the Eastern Cape, where he faces the different life on the country side.
      
      I liked it, and even though I skim read the sections revolving around Lord Byron, the author's language is very terse and powerful. I often find it interesting with main characters who are nuanced, and this professor definitely is nuanced: he's actually not that likeable at all.
      
      <details class="Notice">
        <summary>Spoiler</summary>
        
        The theme of "disgrace" keeps coming back in the book. For me, I could apply it to a bunch of events:
            
        * The professor's disgrace at the university.
        * The disgrace of the student he abused.
        * The disgrace of Lucy after she was raped.
        * The disgrace of Lucy having to marry Petrus for protection.
        
        But most of all, I found the real open goal is how the professor treats the rape of Lucy at a whole other level than his presumed rape of the student Melanie. He refuses to apologise for the latter, he doesn't even bring it up internally in himself, and instead justifying his womanising with his "passion".

She befriends (even if that's a strong word in this case) a homeless man and have a coloured live-in maid, Florence.
      
      This book takes on apartheid full on. Alright, maybe not in the weeds of it, and not throughout the whole text. But rather the certain emotional events and incidents, and the effects it has on individuals.
      
      The author treats the events the woman observes with a certain cool. Or should I say, _she_ treats them such, as it's she who is the narrator. We get to follow her thoughts around her disease and inevitable death. Everything is rather bleak, and the tone of the whole thing is eerie and in the end all fighting, death, and abuse are so meaningless.

      Another South Africa history book. It focuses on "the lie" that is that the land area of Western Cape was mostly uninhabited when the Dutch settlers arrived in 1652. But the author shows evidence that the Khoisan people who were living there, and had an ancient history and rich culture, were fought off with violence and greatly reduced in numbers over time due to war and diseases. A proper genocide, just like in North America.
      
      It was more academic than I thought. Sadly, it made me lose interest in finishing it after getting through 300 pages of a total of ~600 pages. I appreciate to finally read about new perspectives though. The other books above I've read on the subject have been written by white authors.
