      with reading it. In any case, I loved this one: a classic spy novel with "plots and counter plots", as it
      says on the back. I like the author's writing in the way that it's very on point. Like the world he's created,
      the prose is cold and without too many emotions.

      I've finished the final installment of Knausgård's _Min Kamp_ (_My Struggle_) autobiographical series. The full
      collection of volumes goes over 3000 pages, so it suffices to say I'm pretty dazed now. Feels like I've been into
      a tumble dryer and out again.<!--more-->

      _Min Kamp_ is an epic amount of work. It retells Knausgård's childhood, adolescence, university years, and
      eventually becoming a father — this is over four decades of memories he accounts of in excruciating detail. This
      pioneering style of writing, and of course the fact that he writes about real people without changing too many
      names, was what made these novels unique.

      I feel I can't accurately describe how I feel about the series, since English not being my mothertongue. I can only
      praise the level of _detail and honesty_ that has gone into the pages. I am no writer, but I appreciate honesty in
      texts. Also have been a boy, teenager, a young adult, and now a father myself, I identify with areas and scenes
      brought up over the six volumes, each describing encompassing chunks of Knausgård's life.

      What's problematic, of course, with _Min Kamp_ is that he writes about people being close to him, and since he's
      being honest, it's not always positive things. His father, mother, brother, his then-wife, old girlfriends, old
      colleagues are described in the way Knausgård sees them. It's _his_ voice, _his_ views. But he had to do it,
      according to himself, in order to stay honest to the project.

      What I'm most touched and deeply affected by in the end, is his and his then-wife Linda Boström Knausgård's story. It begins in the late 90s, and describes their relationship from being lovers in Stockholm to being a family with
      three kids on the countryside of Skåne in south Sweden. He writes how Linda suffers from being bipolar,
      which climaxes at the end of the sixth volume. It's almost like they became fictional figures for me, since I
      wanted it to work out for them _so much_ I forgot they're real people (they separated in 2016. _Sob_). Their years
      together are described with such intimacy, which I think is required in order to make it honest and real. It made
      me so empathetic towards both of them. The whole situation: Knausgårds need to write, Linda's mental condition,
      their kids, their everyday life. I find myself being happy for them in the light moments, and sad in the dark
      periods. They become real, because they _are_ real.

      Knausgård shows that every person's life is indeed "interesting" and is a well of experiences from which you can draw stories from. Even though he admits later that he wouldn't have done the project if he knew the
      costs, I'm personally happy that he did, since it's a remarkable piece of work. Does he fully portray his wife
      Linda's authentic inner self? No. Is it right to write about his dead father and grandmother in the way he does?
      Maybe, maybe not.

      I've read quite many opinions about the series, and it's what you'd expect: much praise, but a lot of analysis
      going on about ethics, chauvinism, and self-centerism (is that a word?). In the end, I was entertained and adore
      Karl Ove Knausgård's style and angle.

      I liked "Nattens Skola", and became quite immersed in it.

      This is the fourth installment of Knausgård's "Morgonstjärnan" series. It's hard to say if it's a different universe from the other three books. The style is what Knausgård does best, but "Nattens Skola" contains more twists and turns than usual, and the main character is not that sympathetic at all, which is spelled out for us in the text quite early.

      I tend to appreciate novels where there's a jump in time. I love to see the passing of time and how the author treats it with their characters. Here, the first part is in the 1980s, and the second part is 20 years later (the first part has been given the most space). It was also quite refreshing to put it in London instead of Norway.

      In the other books, I had an easier time keeping up with the purpose of the text, whereas in this one, I constantly tried to look for underlying patterns (deeper than the obvious Faustian theme). Maybe I need to read some analytical texts from people smarter than me. Or, it's just "less grand" by design than book number one and three, in the way that there's less of the apocalyptical end-of-days vibe.

      Further, all but one character from the protagonist's time in London in the 80s were discarded. One part of me appreciates that "technique", where I as a reader shouldn't expect random people from the past coming back to the main character — this isn't how real life is anyway. So I was probably coloured by that sensational expectation that something like that would happen. In the end, Knausgård is superb at describing everyday interactions between people, which assembles the book's universe, so that's always a joy in itself.

      After reading mr. Knausgård's pieces for months, I felt a need for reading something by mrs. Boström Knausgård.

      Her prose is beautiful and honest. The book describes her time at a psychiatric ward, where she's going through electric shock treatment, which is a horrible way to "cure" bipolar disorder. Further, she retells fragments from her youth and marriage to Karl Ove Knausgård (where he's the "you" in the text).

      It's a very vulnerable text, dripping of anger towards the system in Sweden, and sadness over the detoriation of her marriage and subsequent divorce. Both subjects hurt to read in different ways.

      There's no way getting away from that there's a darkness laid over the whole text, and I put it down with a stint of melancholia but also empathy towards Linda Boström Knausgård. After it was over, I just wanted her to be happy.

      I'm a sucker for history, so I finished this in no time at all. Maybe I would've preferred a more nuanced view

      actions, and people. Me and others loved _Sapiens_ for that reason. Like, anyone could read Wikipedia about dates

      This novel's prose was fantastic to read. It captures the (chaotic?) inner life of a millennial woman in her late 20s. The stream of consciousness style thoughts are amazingly written, because of how they picture a myriad of _things_ bombarding the main character, like everything from Tinder to ads. Her observations, which frankly are quite objective, of contemporary *bourgeoisie* people around her, are perfectly captured. The text makes couple's dinners feel so fake and messed up.

      I was late to this, but nevertheless I loved reading it. The author's write-as-you-think style is very entertaining and never annoying (sometimes, the prose can get _too_ sloppy). I totally understand that this piece became the eye opening text when it was first released, which told the world How It Really Was in the restaurant business.

      I applaud the author's calls for grit and perseverance when it comes to pursuing a career in cooking. But the clearly toxic elements in the workplace has to go (I hope it's better these days). He also points out — often implicitly but sometimes explicitly — how much the industry relies on immigrants. Salvadorians, Equadorians, Mexicans, etc. And they _work their asses off_ for peanuts. This quote is on point:

      After having watched [_Ripley_](/micro/20240516112200/), I felt I needed _more_ Ripley. This original book by Patricia Highsmith totally offered what I was looking for. The film _The Talented Mr. Ripley_ with Matt Damon and Jude Law only seemingly scratched the surface of Ripley's character: his story felt too fast and hastily told in that film, wheareas the _Ripley_ series gave him much more space. In the book, we can finally follow his own thoughts in third person.

      Highsmith's prose in the novel is, what I guess, super modern for being from the 1950s. Also, in everything Ripley says or does, she manages the balance perfectly between "normal sensitive person" and "psychotic killer". Meaning, she makes us believe that Ripley totally thinks his actions and thoughts are _legitimate_, but not in an absurd, sick way: his disturbing thoughts are always toned down and subtle.

      I enjoyed _The Talented Mr. Ripley_ a lot, especially paired with the tv series _Ripley_.

      This was an interesting piece of work: it's a historical piece but focused on the author's own female family tree in South Africa, ever since the first Dutch settlers arrived in the 1650s. The author has gone through old archives of letters and documentation of select women. She's tracked her heritage from a native Khoisan woman named Krotoa, all the way through intermarriages with the Dutch, through the wife of prime minister Jan Smuts, down to her aunt in present day. It was a super fascinating read, and to put it bluntly: it made "history come alive".

      Woman by woman through history, the author retells a quite vivid picture of some key events, but also every day things. What's clear early (in the forewords) is that the author is 150% on to the idea of "checking her privilege", both when it comes to her whiteness in South Africa, and also because of her relations to the former prime minsiter Jan Smuts. Smuts has been regarded as a national hero in South Africa, and later a grand figure in both world wars. He was promoted to Field Marshall in the UK, and was instrumental in forming both the League of Nations and the United Nations. But, as the author constantly is reminding us of, he was also instrumental in taking the first steps towards apartheid. Lately, he image has been twisted, since in modern eyes, he was quite frankly a good old white supremacist.

      The author goes a long way to remind us of this _colonial guilt_ of her and all white people in South Africa. After a while I felt something like "alright, I get it". But it's a small price to pay: to be constantly reminded of it in a historical book like this.

      This was a classic "comfort read". A middle aged dad brings his family of a wife and two adolescent kids to the French countryside (in Languedoc, nota bene, and not in the oh so popular French Riviera or Provence).

      The book read like a travel log and memoir, and I liked the intimate writing without dropping the rhythm in the story. It was *quite* foreseeable though: how many movies and books aren't there about an American coming to either the Spanish, French, or Italian countryside and learns what's really important in life? It *might* come off as a bit pretentious, if looking at the book from a certain angle.

      Nevertheless, it was — as mentioned — a read that will make you want to go to France, if you didn't want it already. The author spends a lot of time on the topics of wine making and cooking (he's a food writer too, as it turns out, after me googling), which are enjoyable.

      Another history book about South Africa. This focused on recent events at the time of the book's writing: in 1990. Thanks to that, much of the interviews and stories felt *fresh*, as in, the author had just heard or witnessed these things and wrote them down. Note that this was before Nelson Mandela was released and apartheid was deconstructed. For me, reading a book about a racist, authoritarian, police state *while it's still going on*, was a totally new thing (the book included an epilogue written in the late 2000s too).

      The author intelligently jumped between events in the 1830s and present time in the 1980s. The backbone was The Great Treak: the move of thousands of white Dutch descendants from the Western Cape area to north east South Africa due to dissatisfaction with the British abolition of slavery, amongst other things. This journey became a national myth during apartheid.

      *The Mirror at Midnight* had a lot of interviews and anecdotes with anti-apartheid activists, as well as "the other side": the white Afrikaners enforcing the regime's orders. I've read a few detailed texts about life in Eastern Germany during the Cold War, and the similarities are striking. South Africa truly was a horrible police state, with all that entails (fake trials, torture, forced evictions, informer networks, and so on).

      What makes me wonder while reading it is "what are these white people doing today?". Much of the old guard have died out, but all the police officers, mining bosses, and farm owners who brutally assaulted the black population: how do they live now in the South African society? While the country still is heavily segregated, its constitution gives all races the freedom of a modern democracy. I'd appreciate reading interviews with the white people living during apartheid and how they see life now, having to "share" society with blacks — even be ruled by them!

      It would be simple to try to compare this one with [*Moederland*](/reading/moederland), since both treats the highly problematic story of South Africa's past. *Moederland* went further back in history, treating individual women's stories. I preferred *The Mirror at Midnight* as a piece of work however: it was drier and managed to move me more than the sentimental, guilt ridden stories in *Moederland*.

      South Africa continues to fascinate me enormously.

      I usually enjoy short story collections, and I did enjoy this one too. The author surgically describes a range of characters — often misfits — who often appears in each others' stories. It's very raw and "vulgar": nothing is left for the imagination, so to speak. And it's amazing. I was especially touched by all the references to internet culture in the 2000s-2010s in one story. It's a lot of negativity and dark bits, kinda like _A Little Life_, but not that extreme. I felt a bit weird _enjoying_ reading about the characters' meander deep into the abyss, but what the hell.

      First book by South African author J.M. Coetzee I've read, appropriately while I'm in South Africa too. It tells the story about a university professor in Cape Town in the late 1990s who gets fired for having an affair with a student. He then moves to his daughter's farm in the Eastern Cape, where he faces the different life on the country side.

      I liked it, and even though I skim read the sections revolving around Lord Byron, the author's language is very terse and powerful. I often find it interesting with main characters who are nuanced, and this professor definitely is nuanced: he's actually not that likeable at all.

      <details class="Notice">
        <summary>Spoiler</summary>
        
        The theme of "disgrace" keeps coming back in the book. For me, I could apply it to a bunch of events:
            
        * The professor's disgrace at the university.
        * The disgrace of the student he abused.
        * The disgrace of Lucy after she was raped.
        * The disgrace of Lucy having to marry Petrus for protection.
        
        But most of all, I found the real open goal is how the professor treats the rape of Lucy at a whole other level than his presumed rape of the student Melanie. He refuses to apologise for the latter, he doesn't even bring it up internally in himself, and instead justifying his womanising with his "passion".

      Second book I've read by J.M. Coetzee. _Age of Iron_ is set in the apartheid era in mid 1980s Cape Town. It follows an elderly woman sick in cancer, writing a letter to her emigrated daughter. She befriends (even if that's a strong word in this case) a homeless man and have a coloured live-in maid, Florence.

      This book takes on apartheid full on. Alright, maybe not in the weeds of it, and not throughout the whole text. But rather the certain emotional events and incidents, and the effects it has on individuals.

      The author treats the events the woman observes with a certain cool. Or should I say, _she_ treats them such, as it's she who is the narrator. We get to follow her thoughts around her disease and inevitable death. Everything is rather bleak, and the tone of the whole thing is eerie and in the end all fighting, death, and abuse are so meaningless.

      Another South Africa history book. It focuses on "the lie" that is that the land area of Western Cape was mostly uninhabited when the Dutch settlers arrived in 1652. But the author shows evidence that the Khoisan people who were living there, and had an ancient history and rich culture, were fought off with violence and greatly reduced in numbers over time due to war and diseases. A proper genocide, just like in North America.

      It was more academic than I thought. Sadly, it made me lose interest in finishing it after getting through 300 pages of a total of ~600 pages. I appreciate to finally read about new perspectives though. The other books above I've read on the subject have been written by white authors.

      The author started working at Facebook in 2011, and has in the book documented what a shit show of "careless people" the company was and probably is. I reckon it's too much of a symptom among Silicon Valley companies too, since they idolise Mark Zuckerberg's success.

      I enjoyed the book — out of sheer malice — and it quickly became a page turner to see what indifference, incompetence, pride, misogony, or greed would be unearthed in the next chapter. Hopefully it worked as a nice catharsis for the author too.

      Back to history on old East Germany. What intrigued me here was that the book's pitch was to reveal more of the daily life of East Germans, all through out the time period of the 1950s to the fall of the regime in 1990. As promised, lots of small details about both the grand leaders of the state as well as ordinary citizens were sprinkled throughout the chapters. The author has based those details on biographies and letters. We get to follow Walter Ulbricht (first head of GDR), Erich Honecker (last head of GDR), Erich Mielke (head of Stasi), and more. Angela Merkel also makes an appearance.

      Anyhow, what made me like it, and set it apart from other dry history books, was that it helped me shape myself a more nuanced view of life in East Germany (GDR). I was raised by the notion of that it was a) a totalitarian socialist dictatorship, and b) the only thing its citizen wanted was to be freed from this: to be free from both their captors and socialism. a) is still of course true, but the book helped me question b). Among others, I learned these things:

      1. Almost 50% of all East German women were working. The equality levels in the workplace was unheard of in other parts of the Western world. The state encouraged women working both because they badly needed them — so many skilled people had fled in the 1950s — and also because it lined up with the ideology of socialism.
      2. People generally had a good lifestyle with few* worries. State sponsored vacations, domestic and foreign (in the Eastern bloc) trips. Because there was no such thing as a free market, like in capitalism, people weren't concerned with working much to earn their livelihood. They would most likely not end up in the street: there was always work somewhere. The author was sure to mention that there *was* a career ladder, and individuals wanted a Nice Job™ for themselves. But the worries families could have in Western countries didn't exist in the same way, and people in East Germany could put in time into other things, such as beforementioned holidays, socialising with friends and neighbours, etc.
      3. Free university and child care. And other things. These amounted to a very expensive welfare state for the young nation (it was stripped on a ton of its industrial and financial resources by the Soviets in the late 1940s as "payback" for the war). But sticking to its ideology, people didn't have to worry about coming up with a college fund. There were lots of gotchas though: in order to be eligible for That Special University Spot™, you'd have to do military service for some years. Luckily, Sweden (where I was born and raised) doesn't have that _quid pro quo_ state agenda.

      *the population was also surveiled, tortured, couldn't vote in elections, and was generally prohibited from leaving the country. Not to forget.

      The book really told a story about life beyond the wall. I could've wished for a deeper dive into the population's feelings after the regime's fall and during and after the reunification (_Die Wende_). The author touched upon this in the epilogue, but I feel there's space for more. Because I can read Wikipedia for the hard history facts.

      The epilogue included things like "how does it feel when the state you're raised in and the political system you kind of believe in just cease to exist?". I find those kinds of questions so intriguing. The answer was that the population had "mixed feelings": one one hand, they had demanded change from the regime. On the other hand, they were happy with _some_ parts of the socialist system, and had (and East Germans still have) a hard time adjusting to the free market that opened up after reunification (this is a gross over-simplification by me). I want to know more about the _people_, and less about grand historical figures and events.

      This is a novel by Annika Norlin, which also wrote [_Jag ser allt du gör_](/reading/jag-ser-allt-du-gor/). The latter, a short story collection, was a huge favourite of mine, and made me look into _Stacken_, which is her first full length novel.

      It tells the story about the individuals in something of a hippie commune in north Sweden observed by a young journalist from the city, coming to the forest to live in a tent for a while because of burnout. They've chosen to live off grid for around twenty years, by themselves. It starts out in a very harmonic manner, but as you can guess, the darkness is always there to seep in.

      The author has a tremendous grasp over painting vidid characters. We get to follow all the members' invididual "origin stories", and they're very believable. Further, the author doesn't necessarily judge anything (except when describing contemptorary society in a very sarcastic way, stuff I loved from _Jag ser allt du gör_). The language is so rid of judgments when it comes to the choices made by the group that I find them likeable, even though the individuals and the group itself has committed very questionable things. It's around the end where I finally "wake up".

      Now when the book is over, I see that the story arc of such separatist group is a very classic one in litterature and media. It's not that I find any member of the group full of malice — it's naturally more nuanced than that — but during the telling of their stories, it makes sense. _They_ make sense. (I read that the author studied psychology for a while, tells a lot.) If I was a better people reader or more into psychology, I maybe could've explained some very clear telltale signs of the behaviours of the members building up. But I was very captivated by the story and stories themselves.

      Sally Rooney has masterfully told a story about two brothers. Throughout the book, them two became more and more vivid, and I ended up really impressed by the author's ability to describe deep, complex emotions.

      If you read [_Normal People_](/reading/normal-people), you can guess the style of prose, but _Intermezzo_ is just more of everything in there. In the beginning, I didn't like the style where Rooney sneaks in the character's thoughts inline with a normal paragraph. But after a while, I saw how it added to the "stream of consciousness" thing.

      What I like with all works by Sally Rooney is how she manages to make all character's speak in realistic ways. Many of them are really emotionally intelligent (others are not), but it's simply a joy to read how they're reasoning about relationships just the way you'd do in real life. She doesn't gloss over those things. _Intermezzo_ has a hyper focus on _people_. There are no redundant descriptions of anything else than human beings (and maybe a dog).

      This is the second novel of Lydia Sandgren, the first being [_Samlade Verk_](/reading/samlade-verk). As with that one, _Artens Överlevnad_ also spans over multiple time periods (in this case, I think it's fair to say it's 2-3). We get to follow an established author in the 2020s (post-pandemic) who's hired by a Swedish woman in Italy, Alice, whom we also get to follow in her adolescence in 1970s Gothenburg, Sweden.

      The latter time period is heavily marked by the '68 left wing wave. Alice herself come from an upper middle class background, whereas her then boyfriend and other friends are more hardcore leninists/marxists/what-have-you. Sandgren has done her usual research: there are _a lot_ of references, mostly towards intellectual left wing literature and thinkers.

      The former period is contemptorary, and describes the main character Karl's single, childless life in central Gothenburg with subsequent move to Rome. The "intellectual vessel" in this time is his childhood friend who is a longtime psychology student.

      This novel is too an ode to learning and all things classical arts. It's quite frustrating at times, because I can't really put the finger on what's the aim of the book. But for that, I was prepared, because _Samlade Verk_ is similar. The end goal is really the trip there: the meandering descriptions of niche authors and artists mixed with low level personal relationships and how the main characters are affected by them.

      The prose is very correct, but also warm at times when necessary, to describe Karl and Alice's respective personal lives. The novel is quite long, again like it's predecessor, but that didn't bother me. But I suspect that most people will look for "answers" and some kind of aim with the whole book, and remark on it being too long.

      Another Knausgård novel in the _Morning Star_ series. This whole piece, shorter than usual, follows Syvert's (from [_Vargarna Från Evighetens Skog_](/reading/vargarna-fran-evighetens-skog) dad (also named Syvert…) during a few days while his car has broken down near the town of Arendal in west Norway during the 1970s.

      It's just a joy being back in Knausgårds writing and universe again. I don't really care what the overarching story is about. He can publish a book being three hundred or a thousand pages long: I'd read it.

      Svyert the elder is in _Arendal_ quite a nuanced character, but quite how like it is being human. He's wrestling with guilt around his infidelity: he has a relationship with a woman, Anastasia, in then Soviet Russia. We also get insights into his feelings towards his parents, and old childhood friends. On top of that, he's an alcoholic. The thing is, Knausgård's writing is so convincing that I'm swayed to never ever think Syvert is an inherently evil figure. Really fascinating.

      If you thought you'd get any answers to the metaphysical and Biblical hell-on-earth thing Knausgård introduced in the other Morning Star novels, you're wrong. However, the theme about reviving and speaking with the dead is upheld, and Syvert himself is tormented by visions of some sorts.

      I loved it, can't wait for the next one.

        It gets revealed in _Vargarna Från Evighetens Skog_ that Syvert the elder had died in a car accident when his two sons were little. We don't get to witness this in _Arendal_, but until you know that, you kind of sit on needles until the very final page. Knausgård masterfully pictured the death of a young child in [_Nattens Skola_](/reading/nattens-skole) — a climactic moment in the very end of that novel. I stupidly thought he'd repeat that with Syvert-the-father here, but no.

      The autobiography of the journalist and film maker Cameron Crowe is a great read: come for the rock star details, stay for the warm, innocent, and humorous writing.

      Crowe is born and raised in California, and started out extremely early as a music journalist, working primarily for The Rolling Stone magazine. If you've watched his movie _Almost Famous_, you'll recognise some of the story (he based the plot on his own life). Crowe is self-deprecating, humble, and quite thorough in descriptions of his adolescence and formative years. Less so about his later success in adult life. I think that's probably a good call: him interviewing and _hanging out_ with artists such as The Eagles, The Who, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Kris Kristofferson, and The Allman Brothers Band is _quite_ cool if you're a fan of 1970s rock music. I wonder if the same thing could happen today? I wouldn't know.

      He tells us about his successes but also a lot of his fuckups during the book. He describes the fates of broken people, and he writes beautifully about his idols and mentors. It's a warm memoir, and I'd recommend it to people which don't want to forget music that mattered.

      The debut novel by Swedish author Mattias Timander follows a young, unnamed young adult man from the far far north of Sweden. The first person singular perspective is written with the protagonist's local dialect. This could be a gimmick, but it turns out it's not. Me being raised in rural parts, with a local dialect, am somewhat aware of when it becomes A Thing and when the writing becomes an extension of a character's thoughts and self. This novel does the latter.

      The whole text is very compressed — maybe 200 pages or so — but oh how it doesn't feel like that. The emptiness of north Sweden's interior is captured in the pages, not by describing mountains and deer repeatedly, but by describing what the local villagers are _not_ saying. Generations of spite and people just not talking to each other while they're still alive.

      I tend to think the novel is not that credible in describing the man/boy's journey in moving to the city and somehow very quickly becoming involved with the young, chic literature circles, while having no steady income (an inheritence from his parents is mentioned, but me living in Stockholm are doing the math).

      Nevertheless, it's a super performant text, which power in every sentence.

      A memoir of a childhood spent in southern Africa during the 1970s and onwards.

      I love this one (at the time of writing, I'm reading the [sequel](/reading/cocktail-hour-under-the-tree-of-forgetfulness) and have bought the sequel after that). Alexandra Fuller writes about a quite special upbringing — _for being white_ — in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Malawi, and Zambia. Her British parents emigrated to then Rhodesia in the early 70s, and spent almost a decade there farming during the Bush War against the white minority government.

      The writing is incredible. Each new page includes another totally bizarre episode, and it's almost never without humour (except for some incredibly dark moments). The book includes so many problematic parts ("how could the parents decide to stay in Africa during a guerilla war with two small children?"). The obvious racism is quite everywhere — both in the parents but also in the author, since she's a product of this white supremacist society which was Rhodesia — but I think she's maybe somewhat excused in this part due to "using the gaze of the child". This is where the weight is put, at least. The black people around the family have no voice in Fuller's story. I've read reviews of the two sequels saying they are more adult in their tone. Since in this one, there's no real analysis or racial reflections of any sorts besides simply laying out life in Africa as it was. And that's quite strong as it is.

      But still: she and her sister totally survived and grew up. Fuller's love for Africa is still alive, beating. The story _is_ incredible, although the Fuller sisters' upbringing was no worse or harder than the local black children close to them. Maybe it's the strong characters who are their parents which are making the plot what it is? Maybe it's Africa.
