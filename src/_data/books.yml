  notes: "This is an epic describing the live of a couple of individuals from the 1970s until the 2010s in Gothenburg, Sweden. It really touched me, on several layers. I'm very sentimental about the city Gothenburg, and I was constantly impressed by the cultural references, the plot, and the language of the relatively young author. There's this amazing melancholia hanging over the whole work."

  notes: "It's quite rare that a book is written after a film, and by the film's creator too. I loved this one: it's 100% Quentin Tarantino-ness all way through. He has space to go deeper in the conversations between the characters, whose stories he can give justice too. Like the film, it somehow entertains me without having a real plot."

  finished: true
  finishedAt: 2022-06-04T21:00:00Z
  notes: "I bought the Swedish translation as paperback, and read it all in once – back to back. Quite special for a cooking book. The book includes tips and tricks around techniques, equipment, and ingredients. All the traditional French recipies are in here. What I loved about the recipies was that they were both mechanic but yet very much alive. Meaning, the authors' obsession with details, experimentation, and iteration really shined through."
