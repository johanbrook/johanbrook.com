i've bought a new
[bedside alarm clock from Braun](https://de.braun-clocks.com/collections/analogue-clocks/products/bc22-braun-classic-analogue-alarm-clock-white),
and it's so pretty. when activating the back light, it glows in a cool amber light, and then fades
away. drool. i have no idea about the timeline of things, but the green details feels very
Apple-esque. i'd guess Apple borrowed this from Braun when the former designed the iPods, which had
similar green details around the physical knobs and switches.
