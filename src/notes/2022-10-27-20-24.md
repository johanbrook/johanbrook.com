hi again.

last week, i was in portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ (right on the coast) with the rest of lookback. it was lovely to see everybody again. the heart is truly filled until next time.

we're going to south africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ in november! we're gonna be in franschhoek and kalk bay, on the cape. really looking forward, since a) i've never been in south africa, b) after researching, everything seem so cool.

for the month long trip, i've made a list of books to read:

- *The Spy Who Came In From The Cold*, by John le CarrÃ©
- *Grand Union*, by Zadie Smith
- *Vargarna FrÃ¥n Evighetens Skog*, by Karl Ove KnausgÃ¥rd
- *At the Existentialist CafÃ©: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails*, by Sarah Bakewell
- *What We Owe the Future*, by William MacAskill.

just the action of making this list makes me excited.

red hot chili peppers' latest album ["return to the dream canteen"](https://open.spotify.com/album/0KJc9ksnoJJsdpQxV3z5i1?si=n5gq6c42Tpm54YKkAY9DlA) is so good. i love anthony's smooth vocals, and john's solid guitar. they're so very musical.

i've bought an ï£¿watch even though i've said i wouldn't. to my defense, it was a) a used one, and b) i'll only use it for exercising. it's really nice to not bring the phone when running, since i wanna track how good i do. however, i'm really impressed by the watch so far. it's really a marvel of engineering.

i watch "house of the dragon" on HBO, and "rings of power" on amazon prime. the former is really good: even though it doesn't have the intricate storylines from "game of thrones", i like the acting and focus on relationships between parents and children. i also appreciate the focus on the hardships for women of giving birth. "rings of power" is so-so. it feels too CGI, i think, and too "joyful". it doesn't have the raw feeling of peter jackson's trilogy.
