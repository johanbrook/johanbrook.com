## Watched

- **Gangs of New York** (movie) â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†

  I rewatched this and man, it hasn't aged well ðŸ˜“ It doesn't feel like a Scorsese movie at all. The camera, lighting,
  dialogue, fighting scenes â€” everything feels amateurish. Daniel Day-Lewis is the only light in the dark.

- **Let It Be** (movie, Disney+) â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†

  The re-release of the Beatles film from 1970. I had seen much of it in Peter Jackon's *Get Back* documentary, but
  this was a nice condensed version. I love Paul's style in clothes.
  
- **3 Body Problem** (series, Netflix) â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†

  One of the best sci-fi series I've seen. Although there were clichÃ©s and cheesy moments, I thoroughly enjoyed the deeper questions arising around humanity, science, and space.

    It was such a cool angle to have the aliens arrive in 400 years, and in the meantime, having them ruin our science until their arrival. How do we deal with an incoming threat when it's so far away? I like these deeper questions around space, humanity, and aliens.
