## Watched

- **True Detective S04** (series, HBO) ★★☆☆☆

  Good acting, mood, and scenery, but oh so slow paced. Maybe some people appreciate it, but me and the girlfriend just ended up stopping watching this series. It simply didn't entertain us. There was very little character development — the characters weren't that interesting either — and the "mystery" (the case) wasn't compelling nor original.

- [**Purple Noon (1960)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Noon) (film) ★★★★☆

  ![Alain Delon as Tom Ripley](https://www.austinchronicle.com/binary/f265/SS.PurpleNoon.jpg)

  Loosely based on _The Talented Mr. Ripley_, this French film has the most beautiful actors and styling ever. I can't take any screengrabs because of DRM (almost rhymes with _/Go to hell/_), but Alain Delon, Marie Laforêt, and Maurice Ronet are all so damned cool as Tom Ripley, Marge Duval, and Philippe Greenleaf. Jared Leto will always be a fake Alain Delon to me from now on. The film has made me want to replace my wardrobe with white loafers, crisp white cotton Oxford shirts, pink linen shirts, and striped jackets.
  
  So, the movie itself is good too! I find it a bit "weird" sometimes, as you always do with old movies. The pacing is good, but oh how they butchered the Ripley character. In _Purple Noon_, I can't make sense of him at all.
  
  Summarised: come for Ripley, stay for the costumes and scenes of pre-tourism Rome.
