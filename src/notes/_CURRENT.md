## Watched

- **True Detective S04** (HBO) ★★☆☆☆

  Good acting, mood, and scenery, but oh so slow paced. Maybe some people appreciate it, but me and the girlfriend just ended up stopping watching this series. It simply didn't entertain us. There was very little character development — the characters weren't that interesting either — and the "mystery" (the case) wasn't compelling nor original.
