## Watched

- **Gangs of New York** â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†

  I rewatched this and man, it hasn't aged well ðŸ˜“ It doesn't feel like a Scorsese movie at all. The camera, lighting,
  dialogue, fighting scenes â€” everything feels amateurish. Daniel Day-Lewis is the only light in the dark.

- **Let It Be** (Disney+) â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†

  The re-release of the Beatles film from 1970. I had seen much of it in Peter Jackon's *Get Back* documentary, but
  this was a nice condensed version. I love Paul's style in clothes.
