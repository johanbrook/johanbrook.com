## Some movies and tv-shows I've watched recently

- **Everything Everywhere All at Once**. The Academy Award '23 winner. It was entertaining, but I didn't really fall for it. It had cool pacing, strong acting, and an overall well done production, but the storyline didn't interest me a whole lot.
- **The Banshees of Inisherin**. I liked this. Very nice camera, acting, and theme.
