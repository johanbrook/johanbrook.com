Finished watching the David Beckham documentary. I _know_ itâ€™s super produced and sanctioned by the
Beckhams and all that. But. I liked it. Especially the ending, where the family hang out in present
day England at their countryside estate. It felt real, in a way (even though again: I _know_ itâ€™s
staged ðŸ˜„).

It was a cool story arch, even though I guess I appreciated it because of the nostalgia. The _feels_
when images appeared of Luis Figo, Zidane, Ronaldo, Rio Ferdinand, and Ryan Giggs and the others. I
used to play Fifa 2003 on PC with those players, and they were all around when we were talking
football in school.
