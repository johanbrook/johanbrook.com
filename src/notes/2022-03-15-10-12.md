my latest favourite cocktail is this gin sour with bergamot and black tea. you've probably felt the
scent of bergamot in earl grey tea or in perfumes. it's a highly aromatic citrus fruit: it looks
like a large, more spherical, lemon. it's also surprisingly hard to find here in stockholm – even
when it's in season.

i found [this recipe (in swedish...)](https://feeders.se/2022/01/20/earl-greyish-bergamott/) and got
hold of a batch of bergamots through a restaurant friend. i've translated the recipe to english
below:

**Ingredients**

- 5 cl gin
- 3 cl freshly squeezed juice from bergamot
- 2 cl earl grey simple syrup (see below)
- 1 egg white

_Procedure_

1. Pour gin, bergamot juice, simple syrup, and egg white in a shaker.
2. shake like hell for a minute. it should create a lot of foam.
3. add ice cubes to the shaker and shake until the shaker gets cold.
4. strain into a coupe glass and decorate with something green or tea related.

the cocktail will get a lovely orange tea-like colour too!

### Earl Grey simple syrup

**Ingredients**

- 2 dl water
- 2 dl cane sugar
- 1 bergamot
- 2 strainers of black, neutral tea

(this will make more syrup than you need for one drink.)

_Procedure_

1. combine water and sugar in a pot.
2. add the zest of the bergamot (the outer layer of the peel, save the fruit with its juice for the
   drink). avoid the white layer beneath.
3. put everything to a boil for a couple of minutes.
4. remove from the heat, add the tea strainers with black tea.
5. let it sit for at least 5 minutes. it should gain a strong flavour.
6. remove the strainers and let the syrup cool.
7. strain (to remove the bergamot zest) and pour the syrup into a small bottle and store in the
   fridge.

i think the simple syrup is as best the first few days, but mine has lasted over a week now. just
don't forget it in there…
