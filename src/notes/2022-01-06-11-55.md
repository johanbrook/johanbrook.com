i'm coding together something that will let me write post and notes in my static site from anywhere,
and it's super fun. need to deal with github auth and their api, learning about Cloudflare Workers,
and extending lume as i go.

the idea is to create a new post or note file with a request from an authed github session. not sure
how generic i want to make this code â€“ it could be of use for others. the existing "CMSes" i've seen
for static pages are just _too_ much.
