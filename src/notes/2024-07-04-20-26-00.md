Current song obsession is [_Bird In Hand_](https://open.spotify.com/track/2fbjxisAKnRgHSwFUXFXEP?si=867d795f1dc04511) by Lee Perry and The Upsetters. I've listened to it for years, but just now it struck me to research the lyrics.

Turns out I wasn't the first (as always, on the internets 😍). A [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dub/comments/13ke2f/article_on_lee_perrys_bird_in_hand/) described how the lyrics are in fact **Hindi**!

> Milte hi aankhein dil hua deewana kissi ka  
> Afsana mera ban gaya afsana kissi ka  
> Puchho na mohabbat ka asar, haay na puchho  
> Dam bhara mein koyi ho gaya, parwaana kisika  
> Afsaana mera ban gaya, afsaana kisika

The post translates them as:

> As soon as our eyes met, somebody's heart went mad  
> My tale has happened, somebody's tale  
> Don't ask me love's effect, oh, don't ask  
> I took a breath and somebody happened, somebody's lover

Anyhow, I found both forms beautiful: the Hindi one for its vibe, tone, and melody, and the English one for its literal meanings.
