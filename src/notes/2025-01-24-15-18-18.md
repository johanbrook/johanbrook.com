**Code greppability** is such an underrated code metric in how we judge and work with a code base.

At work, we try to be very diligent in how we name

- database columns,
- file names,
- functions,
- one-off variables.

We pick a _noun_ for a new feature and stick with it throughout the "vertical" that forms **from frontend to database**. This makes it really easy to trace a feature's flow through the various layers. Same goes with the _verbs_ that form actions on the feature noun: those should be consistent too.

I use the _greppability_ to my advantage in two cases:

1. **Project wide search.** I hit <kbd>cmd+shift+f</kbd> and search for my keyword.
2. **File search.** I hit <kbd>cmd+f</kbd> and spam `next` to step through all the call sites the feature touches in the local file. This gives me an overview quite quickly.

Some examples:

## Always do named exports

In Javascript:

```ts
// ❌ DON'T
export const myFunction = () => {};

// This has now been renamed 😰
import { myFunction as someOtherName } from './module';
```

Although Language Servers will pick up this on-the-fly alias, we don't like it.

Same goes with default exports:

```ts
// ❌ DON'T
export default function myFunction() {}

// This has now been renamed 😰
import someOtherName from './module';
```

## Be specific

Avoid terms like `utils` and `process` in a feature's various functions. Name it with what they do, specifically.

## Context

Okay, inside of a scoped function (see below), we allow ourselves to be looser with the one-off variable names:

```ts
export const myFeatureCreate = async () => {
    // ❌ DON'T
    const myFeatureExisting = await db.find(...);
    // ✅ DO
    const existing = await db.find(...);
};
```

However, if we use some _other_ feature/model, we are strict with naming:

```ts
export const myFeatureCreate = async () => {
    // ❌ DON'T
    const docs = await db.find(...);
    // ✅ DO
    const otherFeatureDocs = await db.find(...);
};
```

## Problem: Scoping

"Okay, so you don't use the ES Module system to the fullest. How do you cope with name collisions?".

We do it the old fashioned way of… 🥁 _prefixing_! Such as:

```ts
// Some model file
export const myFeatureCreate = () => {};

export const myFeatureUpdate = () => {};
```

If you start typing `myFeature…`, your editor's <abbr title="Language Server Protocol">LSP</abbr> integration will probably autocomplete with a list of the available functions above. Simplicity!
