I've added my [latest iteration of pasta bolognese](/recipes/pasta-bolognese/), you guys. It's the result of many [tweaks](/writings/my-spaghetti-bolognese) and [iterations](/writings/better-spaghetti-bolognese), and is the first one I've actually felt I want to save here on my site, for posterity. We just had it for dinner yesterday and today again, and it's so freaking good: how the meat has melted away into the sauce after 6-8 hours of slow cooking in the oven.
