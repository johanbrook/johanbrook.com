It’s something with the series _The Bear_, I’m just so swept away by the acting in it. In every scene, there’s often some gold.

They sort of slow things dooooown so much in some settings, and it’s panicky hell elsewhere. Like in life. And how they swing between real deep talk-y bits one second and show a short piece of funny moronic “what the actual fuck you meatheads” shittalk in the next.
