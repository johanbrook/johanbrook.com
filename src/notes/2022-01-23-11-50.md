the artist Meat Loaf died a few days ago. his album "Bat Out Of Hell" was the first album I recall playing on CD on my brand new music player when I was ~10 years old. that album â€“ and especially the title track â€“Â was absolutely the thing that got me listening to classic rock as a kid, and then went on to widen my interest in music overall. i have such a strong memory of playing that album in my old room.

"Bat Out Of Hell" was so "grand and majestic", and the songs were sooo long. a stark contrast to the pop songs that was around in the 90s. and the guitar solos sure impressed me as a young child!

bye, Meat Loaf ðŸ’–
