# Seen and done

We've visited a couple of wine estates in the Western Cape area since we got here. And boy, do they have their sales machine up and running. We've mostyl been in the Paarl and Franschhoek areas, but also some in Constantia — closer to Cape Town city centre. I love the relaxed setting most of these places have (people in restaurants, shops, bars are _so_ nice in Cape Town) as well as the divine combo of affordable prices and playgrounds for kids right in the seating area.

# Watched

-   **The Perfect Couple** (series, Netflix) ★★☆☆☆

    I found this having utterly horrible acting and an unoriginal script. The only thing that saved it was Nicole Kidman.

-   **Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story** (series, Netflix) ★★★★☆

    While this was a bit too long, I was completely hooked at least throughout the first 4/5 of the series. The show follows the template of making a drama series of real life serial killers, but I don't care: I was entertained. The acting of the two brothers was great, and the scene design was cool. Always nice to see Javier Bardem too! The show is nerve tickling, since you found yourself not knowing what to believe in the end.

# Read

-   [_Beatles or Stones?_](https://www.thebeliever.net/beatles-or-stones/). Old, long article. Loved it.
-   [_Children of Ash and Elm: A History of the Vikings_](/reading/ash-elm/). Starting reading this, and while it's super interesting, it's a slow pace for me. Maybe I'm not in the zone. Might switch away from it for a while.

While in South Africa, I'd love to read books by local authors, especially historical accounts and stories about individuals.

I've found these so far:

-   _Moederland_ by Cato Pedder.
-   _The Lie of 1652_ by Patric Tariq Mellet.
-   _The Promise_ by Damon Galgut.

# Listened

I've rediscovered Pink Floyd. They were huge for me in my teenage years (somehow), and I think I understand their lyrics better now (no shit). I can have _Animals_ (1977) on in my noise cancelling headphones on repeat, repeat, repeat…

It's also amazing when you "discover" new tracks from your favourite artists. I stumbled upon [_Crystal Japan_](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kAE6N2SGVHAMjatK6SgK3?si=a3d21f918c1b412e) by David Bowie via a Reddit post (forgot the link, sorry), where the poster highlighted that the track [_A Warm Place_](https://open.spotify.com/track/1HsjoAytWxKDxjAV6dLGxW) is _very_ similar to Bowie's track. And it is! There's [a post on it on the NiN wiki even](https://www.nin.wiki/A_Warm_Place). The Reddit user also brought up that the first 1/3rd of [_Fiat Lux_](https://open.spotify.com/track/2VnoUIMNgaChlzuvx1WENa) by Einstürzende Neubaten is also similar. Cool! Three super good tracks — not a bad day.

[This Spotify radio playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8JdEIqA1uhtQ?si=09238b98784d4313) based on _A Warm Place_ is very nice to keep on while working.
