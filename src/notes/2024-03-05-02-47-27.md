This is the final paragraph of Cormac McCarthy’s _The Road_ (no spoiler). It’s the most beautiful paragraph I know of. The weight, the rhythm, the final sentence. Never has a single paragraph done more emotionally to me when I first read it — 15 years old — than a hundred magazine articles on the environmental crisis.

They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.
