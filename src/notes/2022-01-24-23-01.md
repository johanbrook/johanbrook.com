i've bought a new domain for this site! from now on, it's [johan.im](https://johan.im). short and
sweet. johanbrook.com redirects to johan.im.

i appreciate these services/tools soooo much right now:

- Cloudflare
- Fastmail

Cloudflare's dashboard is easy to understand and efficient enough to be dangerous — even though i'm
not a DNS/networking/cache elite ninja. Cloudflare might look simplistic compared to beasts like
AWS, but if you look under the hood, they support more than what they show off (perhaps they should
show off more?). example: like the noob i am, i just redirected `johanbrook.com/* → johan.im/*`. but
the paths after that slash of course weren't kept. so a URL `johanbrook.com/writings` would just end
up at `johan.im` (the root). uh-oh. i read in a
[help article](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427#h_6N5SySNYCjYUUnCKnC1Ea6)
that Cloudflare's Page Rules feature supports _wildcard referencing_. tears of joy! so i could just
do `johanbrook.com/* → johan.im/$1` to keep those nice paths.

Fastmail's wizard for adding a new custom domain is so lovely. i could even pick Cloudflare as my
DNS manager, and they'd customise the wizard for Cloudflare's dashboard UI.
