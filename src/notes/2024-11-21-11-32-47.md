I really enjoy listening to [Baxter Dury](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0EgHhNmWcjusA7F2heSD0O?si=466acd96cf514737). His voice is very unique, and he’s talking over the music in a cool way. I can just keep him in the background with his London accent.

And he succeeds with making catchy hooks, but also intensely deep lyrics. I check out some lyrics and am just *swooning* over some lines.

> Once a sexual forest fire
> My flame had been dampened by the monsoons of fear and age
> And I was in the middle of a perpetual orchard
> Where the shoulderless are kings

From [“Leak and the Disco”](https://open.spotify.com/track/3v8lVgXw0gsBwfYB4bwytq?si=3a3024eca947477e).

> I wanna say something nice to you
> But I don’t think I know how
> I’m just waiting for me to say something I believe

From [“Wanna”](https://open.spotify.com/track/4AENHj2u09XOYMkzwNlp4R?si=90d62aeda3564c37).

And I love the line “Pinot noir sunsets” for some reason, from [“Aylesbury Boy”](https://open.spotify.com/track/2JxopaaLlPWM991AJLYjRW?si=230b898d16954028).
