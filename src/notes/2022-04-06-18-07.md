finished two shows today: Euphoria S02 and Pam & Tommy.

Euphoria is simply amazing. i loved season one. season two is grittier, and while it uses violence, sex, and drugs to describe the world, it’s always the characters that shine through. i’ve never seen better acting than zendaya’s performance as rue.

pam & tommy is kinda of a curve ball. i like it! i didn’t think i would. it manages to take a story (pamela anderson & tommy lee’s stolen sex tape in the 90s) and make a whole series about it. i liked the sentimental rendition of their mutual love for each other. also, the issue of men vs. women in terms of leaked nudes is also brought up. “i was in that tape too!”, says tommy. “it’s not the same! i’m.. i’m.. a woman!”, says pamela. and it’s not just hollow talk: the series actually manages to showcase how pamela suffered.

i also appreciated the 90s LA vibe ☀️
