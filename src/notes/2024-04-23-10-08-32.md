I've made an observation with regards to the quality and style of my writing: after years of constructing mostly short sentences in Slack and on Twitter/Mastodon, my prose style is *really bad* (for my standards).

It's like writing only in chats where clear, short communication is key has made my long form writing much worse. It's tangent to the thing where people have too short attention span for reading books after years of only reading click bait headlines and social media posts.

I guess the fix is to read and write more prose.
