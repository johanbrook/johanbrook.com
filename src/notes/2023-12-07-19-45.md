[ArrowJS](https://www.arrow-js.com) is my spirit animal JS library at the moment.

*If* you need a library on the frontend, I’d use this one.

- ✅ tiny (2kB). can read the source code in 10 min.
- ✅ reactive, with observable signals/atoms.
- ✅ no build, no JSX, no dependencies.

It abstracts away sharp edges with the DOM, and does the reactive boilerplate for you. I could easily just copy-paste the source into a vendor/ directory and call it a day.
