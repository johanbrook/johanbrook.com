hello world. this is me testing my new GUI for posting these small notes. i'll probably write a
longer post about it later.

in a nutshell, i've written a _barebones_ JS client to talk with GitHub's API to post a new file in
this repo. no dependencies used. it was a fun challenge writing old school DOM JS manipulations
again.
