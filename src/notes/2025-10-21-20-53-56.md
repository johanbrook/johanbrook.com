Stumbled upon [FitLang](https://fitlanguage.org) by Blain Smith. A sweet little grammar to mark up workout programs as well as logging them. Both the idea and syntax reminds me about [CookLang](https://cooklang.org) — both are wonderfully nerdy engineery solutions to everyday chores.

What gets me going on these things is that they're **open, shareable text files**. My data is not hidden away in some Google spreadsheet or SQL database in the cloud. Treating FitLang files as the base primitive, then parsing them into some other data structure for operations (maybe for pretty gym graphs or whatnot).

Copied from one of the examples:

```fitlang
>> 12-Week Push/Pull/Legs Program %12weeks

#day1 >> Push Day
@bench press{4x8@75%} with ~3min rest between sets.
@overhead press{3x10@moderate}
@tricep dips{3x12@bodyweight}

#day2 >> Pull Day
@pull-ups{4x6@bodyweight} or @assisted pull-ups{4x8}
@bent-over rows{3x10@moderate}
@bicep curls{3x12@light}

#day3 >> Leg Day
@squats{4x10@80%}
@lunges{3x12 each leg@bodyweight}
@calf raises{3x15@bodyweight}
```

Here's the repository for the [full specification](https://codeberg.org/fitlang/spec).

Writing my own gym app has been on my mind lately (because "why not, I have time, right?"). Maybe it should be FitLang Compatible®.
