i've rewrote my site (using [lume](https://lumeland.github.io) ðŸ’›) and made a ton of tweaks. classic
neverending parental leave chores. it's built with [deno](https://deno.land), which I love even
more. i'm finally free from the node/npm APIs and build systems! everything is much simpler now, and
i should probably write about it in the even more classic post of "i've rewritten my blog" which
usually shows up in January every year.
