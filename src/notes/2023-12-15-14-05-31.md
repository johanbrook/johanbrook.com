I was in a bookstore to get a Christmas gift today over lunch. It was an independent, small store —
not one of the big book chains’ shops. Many books had small paper notes with the staff’s personal
thoughts, and many were signed by the authors, who frequently visited the shop on signing events and
book talks.

I just got a really fuzzy feeling entering the small venue, and even more so after chatting with the
sole clerk.

Entering a bookstore is like entering a whole separate universe where time stands still. When I was
travelling around in the world, I would always get to a bookstore when in a new city just to feel
“rooted” — kind of like finding a safe house.
