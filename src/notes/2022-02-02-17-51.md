i love creating playlists. it's like the lost art of making mixtapes for yourself of somebody else.
even though Spotify (and other services surely) have invested _a ton_ content curation, i still love
my own hand made playlists. spotify, for instance, have a lot of both automated and handmade
playlists for a myriad of occasions. they're kinda niche and cool, but… i still think they're a bit
bland.

what i appreciate is that it's a constant, living project. this categorisation builds up over time
as i discover new material, and i'm now wired to place it in a playlist if i like the track. good
for future johan and others.

here are some of them:

- [Johan Recommends 👌](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Ldhvei26A52VXc1ErGFE3?si=7784bde2b4864c83).
  this one has been around since i got a beta invite to Spotify. i dunno, perhaps 2008? the listing
  doesn't tell the date of the two earliest tracks added (just a blank column). this playlist is
  just a dump of what i'm listening to at the moment. it forms a nice history of what i liked over
  the years.
- [☕ Programming](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2mtlhuFVOFMn6Ho3JmrLc2?si=01e2e74df939457c).
  music i code to. mostly techno and instrumental.
- [👌 Feels Good Man](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sQMuWwPINJiLZUJK4Z3uD?si=c1900108fe7946fa).
  reggae and dub. i've been listening to this constantly over the past year, haha. i just can't get
  over how good, deep, and rich this genre is.
- [💑 Music for Eating](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5nh0YK8EONkjzOnbA3BhUY?si=bb2ee94098424d68)
  started as a playlist for a dinner in 2012, now it's my general "turn something on 5 min before
  guests arrive" kind of playlist. it's mostly "safe", as in "nobody and their partner will get
  annoyed by the songs in here".
- [🎶 Music from the Old World](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7q5ibEnI11LGt6OfPdUiYF?si=71eee722055a42e7).
  i curate this one like a mad man. **only** good, timeless songs in here! think "if mankind would
  go under tomorrow, what would you save in a box and shoot out in outer space". this is music that
  i think are masterpieces and that has affected my interest in music somehow.
- [🍝 Cooking](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1gogip1RT6OUnbvdnTi6Pl?si=ac2453416add46c0). music
  i cook to! fun! creative!
- [🌧 Moody](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/59nplETeaMx3BmSJ0HmueD?si=40dfed3c765943a3). you know
  all these corny spotify playlists "Upbeat Summer" and that? this is the reverse. downbeat.
- [🔫 Rhythm And Poetry](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7iN8d1FOc4MPI1kdviSaKz?si=7fd232edf03940f4).
  90/00s hiphop – when it was good.
- [🌞 Music I've Grown Up To](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/078GhmeGcbKJgRZD8dy6Rk?si=d2e15235ff4e45cf).
  songs i've listened through from teen to adolescence. music that somehow has affected me during
  emo periods, travels, and just everyday life.
- [🇧🇷 Bom día, Rio de Janeeeeiroo!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3BNTm0AP9uiM0KIXc8iHEr?si=170da54d9da443c1).
  my brazilian playlist, which i created when i was in Rio. classic bossanova and samba mixed with
  brazilian funk.
- [🇸🇪 Absolute Swedish](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5oJPfALfNLPFrq5gxWuude?si=982a8f0ae3e44338).
  only swedish songs. makes me kind of proud over how much good music the little nation of sweden
  has produced.
- [🛣 On the Highway](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6iXHobR6yJaPqgBaaL64xX?si=dd229408c5bf4121).
  road trip songs without songs that mention "road trip".
- [💦 Rain](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3nuTeGLROOyh5t4VMKTp13?si=2262e0a243c74c16). for rainy
  weather.
- [🇫🇷 The French Affair](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5zFLAiAjNowbHSSgMOC4RE?si=0cf90c6f01d44928).
  french music. for when you wanna … listen to … french music?
- [🎸 Soul/Jazz/Blues](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4M9CK0W1O4Kcdqz5Yy2Qzh?si=6343cd67b7c94935).
  a big ol' bucket with these three genres. bam!
- [🍂 Autumn](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0C0bD6e5aOZqPwPgVl9Ail?si=5ca31048878e4ec1). moody
  music which somehow feels more autumn-y.
- [🌻 Summer!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5eItx1PWuOqZ6wKjcq6MFv?si=69f8937279744315). the
  mandatory, upbeat summer playlist. i'm sorry.
- [🌅 What's the story morning glory](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1F3AXwgZIi90ArZb9Vwykb?si=1efe867ebf114bce).
  the morning playlist that gets you UP.
- [📽 Hipster Internazionale](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4vX0My1z66vnhiequGGdYM?si=7a538d36e04147e7).
  hipster and indie songs you haven't heard of.
