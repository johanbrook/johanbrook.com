Summer is over, after vacation in August down on the Swedish west and south coasts. Weather was
so-so, but it was nice with a change of scenery. We also spent the month of September in Florence,
Italy, which was such a blast. We travelled abroad with our 10 months old daughter for the first
time, and everything went quite well actually (I had expected the worst). I was so inspired by the
stay in Italy, and hope I can bring some of that energy into the day-to-day life back in Sweden.

On Monday I'll officially start my parental leave until April 2022. Scary but exciting. I'm actually
looking forward to just _not work_ for the first time in 7 years. Who knows what kind of person I'll
be after this leave?

I was inspired by the book "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" by Haruki Murakami, so I
want to start running this Autumn.

Also, I'd like to start making my own pasta. I took a pasta making course in Florence, and it was
super fun. So simple! So fresh!
