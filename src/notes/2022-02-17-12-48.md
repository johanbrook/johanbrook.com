## The best fruits

1. **Banana.** they're full of vitamins, fibers, and natural sugars. they provide the best energy, and are easy to a) carry around, b) peel. they're perfect.
2. **Mango.** whenever i get to pick flavours for (let's say) ice cream, i always pick mango (or a combo of mango + something else). they *are* the best tropical fruits when it comes to flavour. they're less easy to peel and deal with than a banana
3. **Clementine/Satsuma/Tangerine.** easy to handle and somewhat easy to peel. the best of juices, and full of vitamins. makes the day brigher.
4. **Pear.** sweeter than apples, with a soft, moist flesh full of fibres. they can be watery though, so not as rich as mangoes and bananas.

â€¦

1000. **Pineapple.** i really hate these. ugly, hard shell, weird flavour. i would never carry these on a trip, nor try to peel them as an ingredient.
