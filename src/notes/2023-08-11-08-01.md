The show "Full Circle" on HBO is good. Made by Steven Soderbergh. It uses unconventional camera — a raw lens from lower angles — which makes the city lights of New York appear "as they really are".

Yesterday, I watched the series finale of "Little Drummer Girl" (also on HBO). It was so good. Park Chan-Wook directed it. The late 70s costumes, interior designs, and locations were spot on. And the characters were nuanced and non-cliché. Gotta continue my John le Carré run now by reading the novel.
