The album
["Right Time"](https://open.spotify.com/album/1S7rBJNPNrCvtdF38sp0Gs?si=3mBWnZBcRPqnmLb7QkXDPA)
(1976) by Mighty Diamonds might be the best reggae album I've heard. Even better than the epic
["Heart of the Congos"](https://open.spotify.com/album/0FqUTYrs4FtPbav2Ry2I1M?si=D4cDCKcURb21lxSvoqeZSA)
(1977) by The Congos.
