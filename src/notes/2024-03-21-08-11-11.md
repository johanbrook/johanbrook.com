It's my first week of parental leave with my second daughter, and I'm _here for it_. Hanging out in the kitchen, taking
time to prep food, listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/album/15q7N7Wo307mfjqR29NpjF?si=Nn2sveRrT-63afwfTtq6WQ)
with the baby. I'm appreciative for entering Swedish Spring and Summer this time too.

Last time, I found the parental leave being a great "brain reset" in order to get perspectives. It (forcefully) slowed
down my every day life and made it revolve around fewer things. It also leaves space ‚Äî outside of work ‚Äî for project
ideas. For instance, I just thought about coding something with an LLM that suggests recipes based on groceries I've got
home at the moment. I'd have less energy for these kinds of silly things if I was to work full time too.

I think this time, I'll enjoy it even more thanks to the fact that you're 1000x more of a pro and more relaxed with the
second kid üòè
