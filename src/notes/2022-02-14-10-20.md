i love this quote from Nils van der Poel (emphasis mine):

> I think it's important to understand that you're not doing it for a gold medal. **Regardless of which life you chose to live, you will sacrifice something, that's the way it is.**
>
> As soon as you go in one direction, you also choose to not go in all other directions at the same time. It's the basic precondition for going anywhere at all.
>
> But on the path you take, you will experience fantastic things, even though it's uphill there will be a great view when you're at the top, and that's what makes it worth it, to be on this journey with people you love. It doesn't matter that much where the journey ends. A movie with a sad ending is also a good movie - and a movie with a nice ending makes you happy.
>
> I'm very happy for this medal around my neck, and for getting all the way here. But why do you do it? I don't think you get to pick your dreams, they pick us. It's up to us to realize them or not, and it seems like people who try to realize their dreams are happier.

Nils van der Poel is a swedish olympic speed skater who just won two gold medals in the beijing 2022 olympics.
