I've finally stopped using Twitter now. Feels weird. The reason was that they shutdown API access for 3rd party clients, like the one I'm using: Tweetbot. That was the last straw for me. I'm out. I have zero energy for using Twitter's apps. I'm going all in on Mastodon now.

Luckily, the creators of Tweetbot have released Ivory â€“ an iOS app for Mastodon. It's the same look and feel as Tweetbot, which is amazing. I've started to like Mastodon a lot now. I wrote [a post](/writings/mastodon) about it too.

Long live Twitter. Goodbye, old friend ðŸ‘‹
