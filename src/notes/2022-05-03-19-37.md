the musical experience which had most impact on me was one time in gothenburg, at a sleazy karaoke bar. one woman came up to the mic, and it *looked* like she had been through a lot in her life. i don't know, i just felt it. then she went on and did the most emotional and beautiful version of alanis morissette's "ironic".

totally blew me away. the song was *hers*.
