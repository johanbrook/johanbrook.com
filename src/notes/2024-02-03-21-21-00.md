Maybe it's because I've spent the past weeks in a beachside environment, with very few worries
besides watching the baby so she won't eat the sand, but I just don't care for a _single_ bit about
new hardware announcements such as the Apple Vision Pro any longer.

It's so relieving.

Not trying to be smug or snowflake about it. I simply feel so _beyond_ those kinds of thought
streams where I spend more than a second checking the said hardware out.
