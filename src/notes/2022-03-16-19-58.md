i don't think everyone need heavy test runners and framework for every project. a single file with
`import assert from 'assert'` (node) and a bunch of assertions can suffice for a tiny prototype
project.

if you want more structure, where do you go? the npm libraries `tape` and `tap` have ~20
dependencies each. `ava` has ~40. i don't even want to think about `jest`…

i'm sure these packages are great for certain things. but here's a minimal test runner i've written:

**[Johan's Test Runner →](https://gist.github.com/johanbrook/598d07fa89357f8577d6d0d6e88747a5)**

it works as you'd expect:

1. create a test file.
2. import `test` and write test cases.

```ts
import { test } from './_test-helper';
import assert from 'assert/strict';

test('it works', () => {
	assert.equal(true, true);
});
```

i use node's `assert` for assertions. want typescript support? add `esbuild` and `esbuild-register`
as dev dependencies and run tests with:

```bash
node -r esbuild-register run-tests.ts
```

the runner supports returning promises, as well as printing fancy file names for each test case.

i appreciate taking this approach before jumping to `npm install <dep>`. it gives me very much peace
of mind, as long as you don't spend too much time maintaining your own tooling.
