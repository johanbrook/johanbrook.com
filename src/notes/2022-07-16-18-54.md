lookie here, haven't posted in a while. this is how it goes when you have a full time job, and not being on parental leave!

for my own memory, these are things i want to check out at the moment:

* the [SolidJS framework](https://www.solidjs.com).
* building a UI frontend for managing static site generators with [tauri](https://tauri.app).
* my work-in-progress app for reminding me to get in touch with friends, using [remix](https://remix.run).

overall, things are pretty chill. i'm [reading](/reading) the autobiography of keith richards, and i'm actually enjoying it. thought it would be another sleazy rock star bio, but it kind "sounds" like he actually wrote it. also, he's got a great memory. too bad i want to buy a new acoustic guitar now, AND an electric oneâ€¦ ðŸ’¸

i'm enjoying watching the women's euro cup in football. there are so much less free kicks overall, due to â€¦ they're doing less movie tricks i guess? or are just toucher. the quality is super high (more than a few years ago, they say), and i appreciate it a lot.
