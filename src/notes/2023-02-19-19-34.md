Did a small re-align of my site. Nothing too big. Just some spring cleaning, visually. Feels good.

I've landed in a nice rhythm of doing exercise now. Combining running and weight lifting. My
constant gripe with the latter is to have to eat so goddamned much all the time to get any growth
effect out of the gym sessions, but whatever.

Watched _"All Quiet On The Western Front"_ yesterday. It's a Netflix produced film (but it was super
good!) about a solider in the German army during World War I. It's based on the book with the famous
title, a source of many dad phrasings over the years (dads throwing in the reference "all quiet on
the Western front" in conversations when receiving the question "how do you do"). The film was
amazing in the sense of production, but also (I guess) authenticity (the dialogue is German ðŸ’ž). The
sheer horror of war was pictured in a deeply touching and soul draining way.
