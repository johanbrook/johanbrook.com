During the past month, we've been ramping up our planning and packing before the move to Cape Town, South Africa. Very exciting. I'm even past the slight resistance to tear up routines and leave friends and family, and instead 150% into the adventure bits.

I started working again after a couple of months off with the latest child. To be honest, I'll miss the hell out of her. We'll meet every single day still of course, but we *probably* won't have this long uninterrupted time together again, and she obviously won't be in this age forever… Even though I love my job and colleagues, I could see myself work *less*. I've come to not like the idea of that somebody else owns my time.

## Watched

- **True Detective S04** (series, HBO) ★★☆☆☆

  Good acting, mood, and scenery, but oh so slow paced. Maybe some people appreciate it, but me and the girlfriend just ended up stopping watching this series. It simply didn't entertain us. There was very little character development — the characters weren't that interesting either — and the "mystery" (the case) wasn't compelling nor original.

- [**Purple Noon (1960)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Noon) (film) ★★★★☆

  ![Alain Delon as Tom Ripley](https://www.austinchronicle.com/binary/f265/SS.PurpleNoon.jpg)

  Loosely based on _The Talented Mr. Ripley_, this French film has the most beautiful actors and styling ever. I can't take any screengrabs because of DRM (almost rhymes with _/Go to hell/_), but Alain Delon, Marie Laforêt, and Maurice Ronet are all so damned cool as Tom Ripley, Marge Duval, and Philippe Greenleaf. Jared Leto will always be a fake Alain Delon to me from now on. The film has made me want to replace my wardrobe with white loafers, crisp white cotton Oxford shirts, pink linen shirts, and striped jackets.
  
  So, the movie itself is good too! I find it a bit "weird" sometimes, as you always do with old movies. The pacing is good, but oh how they butchered the Ripley character. In _Purple Noon_, I can't make sense of him at all.
  
  Summarised: come for Ripley, stay for the costumes and scenes of pre-tourism Rome.
  
- **The Greatest Night In Pop** (documentary, Netflix) ★★★★☆

  I like music documentaries. This one was about a thing I totally haven't given a single thought during the past 20 years: the song and event that was _We Are The World_ by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. I grew up in the 1990s hearing it from time to time. This very easily digested film let Lionel Richie retell the story about how the recording of the song came to be, and the various artists involved.
  
  A few things struck me:
  
  1. Lionel Richie came off as a really cool guy in the 80s.
  2. I was happy to learn that the creative drive and leadership in this was made up mostly by people of colour (Lionel, Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Harry Belafonte).
  3. The 80s was so *cute* in a way that they got a ton of stars together in a studio *after an award's ceremony* and recorded the song into the early morning hours. This is the main thread in the documentary too — how they managed that — but it all seemed so unpretentious, down to earth, and full of comradery.

- **Squaring the Circle: The Story of Hipgnosis** (documentary, Netflix) ★★★★★

  A documentary about something hugely underrated: a graphic design studio making album covers. I knew about Hipgnosis before, but only on the surface. They were two pals from England that formed a graphic duo that would create iconic pieces of album artwork for roughly 10 years, for artists like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Paul McCartney, and Peter Gabriel. It was a joy to hear about their sheer creativity and close collaborations together. It echoed of a world were music really mattered, as did the package it came with. In the end, it's a lot about money — I get that — but the documentary's focus on these two guys' creativity formed a nice oasis from that.

- **Furiosa — a Mad Max Saga** (movie, Netflix) ★★★★☆

  A prequel to *Mad Max — Fury Road*. I'm not an action movie kinda guy. I enjoy things like *The Matrix* and maaaybe *John Wick* because it's well done. But whoa, these two latest reboot films in the *Mad Max* franchise are insane.
  
  We get to follow a young Furiosa — her origin story. It has the same intense car chase scenes as *Fury Road* (is the camera team speeding things up? There's something in there making all the movements look overly intense). The movie spares no prisoners: it's kind of raw, and you're never actually sure about what any character may do. I'm not smart enough as movie critic to pinpoint exactly what, but the latest *Mad Max* films have *something* that make them really really good.
  
- **Kaos** (series, Netflix) ★★★★☆

  Other reviewers would probably give this one three stars, but I'll be honest: I was entertained! The cast is amazing (Jeff Goldblum 😍 in a track suit 😍😍) and I think the narrative bridge between Greek mythology and the modern world was made in a relaxed and funny way.
