I had always been an "anti e-book reader person", or conversely, "pro physical book person". In hindsight, I'm not sure why: the constant argument had been "I'd like to read _real_ books, please!". Hold them, carry them, feel them. Etc. etc. It's 150% the sentimentality around books as manifestation of a cultural thing that has been around for hundreds of years. The last bastion, where the digital revolution yet hasn't been able to put its bits-and-bytes hands on.

It's also the vanity thing of collecting physical artefacts (and perhaps showing them off). I'm the first to admit that I like to keep books in my bookshelf! Even though lately, I've borrowed more books from the local library when the titles have been quite rando, as in "hm, I'm not sure I'll ever gonna re-read this or recommend it to somebody".

Anyhow. With e-readers, you lose both the physical sensation and the showing-off of real books. And it's amazing!

*From now on, this text is about Johan being a decade late in discovering e-readers.*

For a longer trip I'm currently on, I bought myself an e-book reader. It's a [Kobo Clara 2E](https://eu.kobobooks.com/sv/products/kobo-clara-2e). I refused Amazon's Kindles due to lock-in and dislike of Amazon. I got myself a magnetic cover, and off I went.

Before, I made damn sure this Kobo thing was *open* enough to transfer these types of ebooks onto it:

* Random, free EPubs books.
* DRM protected EPub books.
* Library ebooks.

as well as sampling books out of the Kobo store. It supposedly has millions of books, and after some sampling, I determined that it had the titles I was going to read during my trip. Perfect!

The Kobo reader is really good. It has a great display, kind of water proof, has good battery life (I've charged it once since I got it in mid January, now is late Feburary), a perfect form factor.

The form factor is something I especially appreciate: I can fit it in my back pocket. I don't think the display is too small at all (6 inches, 300 PPI). Anywhere when I got a minute over, I can just haul it up and get some pages read. You *could* do the same with a physical book, but even a paperback of 600+ pages will be a bit of a brick to carry around. The result? I read in a much higher pace, and therefore a lot more books (since January 14th, I've read four books for a total duration of 56 hours). I feel genuinely excited for how this has lowered the threshold for reading more books.

It's almost like one of the charms with physical books became its baggage: to physically acquire them and transport them around. The ritual became a gatekeeping activity for me. With the e-book reader, it's as capitalistic and digital as it can be: I find a book in the Kobo store, buy it with my Apple Pay, and sync it on the device via my account. No more the feels of "opening the first pages of a freshly bought book".

Oh, I've almost forgot _the_ best thing about ebook readers! The ability to read in the evening in the bad shared with a partner who *does not* want to have any lights on!
