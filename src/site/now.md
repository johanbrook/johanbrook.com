## Since the last update…

…I've become a father. In December, our daughter was born. It's a whole new life, but it feels very natural. We're happy that she's well, and every day is bringing something new with it.

## Reading

I've finished:

- "Röde Orm", by Frans G. Bengtsson.

### Currently reading

_"Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History Of Punk"_, by Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain.

### Want to read

"Utvandrarna", by Vilhelm Moberg.

## Habits to keep

- Keep off Instagram.
- Keep off Facebook.
- Keep going to the gym (it's good for you!).
- Keep reading books.

## Aspirations for 2021

- Spend as much time as I can with my daughter.
- Try to travel abroad, if possible.

If my life changes, I'll update this page.
