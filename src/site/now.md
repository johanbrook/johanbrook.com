## Since the last updateâ€¦

â€¦I'm married with my fiancÃ©e ðŸŒ· We decided to get married this year after all â€“ earlier, we had to cancel our planned wedding due to Corona. But we planned this tiny little ceremony to be in the mountains of Sweden (near FunÃ¤sdalen, around the border to Norway), and it included just our four parents as witnesses. The ceremony was on a Friday, and we hung out in the cabin during the week, hiking and cooking. It was super good weather. The whole week made me more sure I want to live in a place with _few_ people in the future. The Swedish mountains has something magical over them. The small towns around have low population count, but radiates some kind of _dignity_. Anyhow, after the ceremony, me and fiancÃ©e spent the afternoon in a spa and spent the night at an [old style mountain hotel](https://www.fjallnas.se/sv/). Highly recommended.

â€¦We've bought a car: a Subaru. Finally bit the bullet. I've personally tried to delay this even as long as possible, for environmental and economical reasons. But with a kid on the way, and an increase preference for travelling to remote places, we bought a car. It's super good, and I'm happy with the decision. The flexibility is insane â€“ I think every generation needs to discover the freedom of being able to transport oneself. The feeling is hard to beat.

â€¦I've started making more cocktails at home. Classic #coronaactivity. I got myself a proper shaker kit for my birthday, with some base spirits. It's super fun to make Old Fashioneds, Boulevardiers, and Gimlets!
