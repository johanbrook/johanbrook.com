## Since the last update‚Ä¶

- Got engaged with my girlfriend, now fianc√©e üíç
- Visited Sri Lanka in early January.
- Finished a few books:
  - "The Alchemist" by Paolo Coelho.
  - "The Zahir" by Paolo Coelho.
  - "The Snow Leopard" by Peter Matthiessen.
  - "The White Book" by Han Kang.

## Currently reading

A Swedish thriller, _"Bj√∂rndansen"_, which is nice to relax the brain with.

I haven't finished _"The Uninhabitable Earth"_ due to it being very repetitive in the beginning (I got tired of all the numbers). I'll see if I return to it.

## Habits to keep

- Keep off Instagram.
- Limit Facebook usage to once per week.
- Keep going to the gym (it's good for you!).
- Keep reading books.

## Aspirations for 2020

- Be more physical when interacting with people, even the ones I don't know so well.
- Write a novella.
