## Since the last updateâ€¦

- Bought an apartment with my cool girlfriend. Stockholm is really my home now.
  - Got walls painted and floor done. Currently furnishing it, slowly and steady, while enjoying the ride.
- Made some redesigns to this site.
- Went to three Lookback retreats during the year: Palm Springs ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, Stockholm ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª, and Barcelona ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. Amazing to spend good time with the brightest people I know.
- Had a great Swedish summer vacation with girlfriend. As much as I love travelling, I cherished just being home in Sweden during the best summer weeks.

## Currently reading

_["The Uninhabitable Earth"](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/27/the-uninhabitable-earth-review-david-wallace-wells)_ by David Wallace-Wells. Important and horrifying.

## Habits to keep

- Keep a private micro journal in iPhone notes. Note down thoughts each day, how dull they might be.
- Keep off Instagram.
- Keep going to the gym (it's good for you!).

## Aspirations for 2019

- Get into the habit of painting.
- Take swims in our lake during the autumn and winter.
