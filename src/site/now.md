## Since the last update…

…we've managed through the spring with our daughter! It's beyond expectations. I'll be off for parental leave in October, but before that we hope to go to Italy for a month. It's the first time in 7 years I'm off work this long, so I'm a bit nervous but of course excited. I'm not sure what to expect yet, since I don't know what kind of person she'll be at that time. But I'm looking forward to see how _I_ am as a non-working person. I'm not worried, just curious.

Corona is still a thing in Stockholm, so there's been a stay-at-home Spring, naturally. But I'm really happy over us doing so many fun outdoor things with friends and family. We've managed to gather a lot of people for outdoors drinks and food, and of that I am proud and happy.

The summer is looking good for us. A nice mix between family hanging and domestic traveling. We'll go down to the west and south coast of Sweden, which is amazing. I'm thankful for our car (which I just bought new tires for).

I've been learning the programming language Rust on some evenings. It's exciting to learn something new again, where I'm thrown into a whole new paradigm. I'd like to write a post with my findings too.
