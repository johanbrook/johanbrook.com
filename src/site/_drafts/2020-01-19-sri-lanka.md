**Before this trip, I had never been to Asia before.** During my early twenties, I didn't go backpacking in the Philippines, Bali, or other southeast Asian contries, as some people did in that age. I don’t know exactly why I haven’t. However, looking back, I'm not sure I "missed out": there's just been a delayed appreciation and understanding of Asia. It's blunt to say "Asia" here though, since it's a myriad of nations, cultures, languages, and traditions. Sorry about that. But I use it to differentiate it from the Western culture I'm brought up in, and the norms I'm used to.

So me and my girlfriend decided to go to Sri Lanka during three weeks in early January. After spending the Christmas with respective families in Sweden, we board a plan in Stockholm and arrive on New Year's Eve in Colombo.

## Arrival

The first thing hitting me is the humid heat. It's the same heat as in South America: it's everywhere around me. We go in a car from the airport directly down towards the south coast and I watch the dense jungle that surrounds the highway. There are houses too, even though they are more in the class of "cabins" or "shacks", many of them half finished and mere shells. It's slowly becoming pitch dark outside, and some rain arrives. I'm hot as hell, and it's very humid. Mixed with the tiredness from the flight, the humidity is annoying – I feel worn out and unclean – but there's of course nothing to do about it. We stay by the road to withdraw some cash and to get some light food.

We arrive in the village [Ahangama](https://goo.gl/maps/usBFRzecMpRCKpESA) after a three hour drive. Originally a small fishing village, it has seen some expansion from tourism, but not at all at large scale (yet). All commercial buildings lie on both sides of the Matara Road which goes along the whole south west coast. This is moment where I'm hit with the "Asia experience" for the first time: it's busy, noisy, slow, hectic. Tuk-tuks are everywhere, like small bees. People hang out on the curb and in shops. Girlfriend notes that this is "very lightweight" compared to larger towns and cities.

Our housing in Ahangama, where we'll stay for seven days, is basic but enough. It's a simple hostel with 3-4 rooms, run by a Barcelona woman in her thirties. She just recently started the place, and she's full of energy and has a warm but clean interior design taste.

We spend New Year's Eve on a bar called "Follow the White Rabbit" (the name is probably inspired by the plot in _"The Matrix"_ movie). This is my first evening out in this country. Everything is very cheap compared to Sweden and the Swedish currency. I almost feel ashamed of how cheap I think the food and drinks are. This will become a recurring thing while I'm here: the embarrassment over how little we pay for services, housing and food. It's a different world with a different system. I think of all the years of colonial rule (Portuguese, Dutch, British all were in Sri Lanka), where the west sucked out what they could in terms of natural resources, while the locals were left in a poor state. It's apparently not as bad as in India (not to speak of Africa...), and I don't see many people on the streets, publically begging for money. But I haven't researched that subject enough to explore it further here.

## Getting into the rhythm

The following days are mainly spent on various beaches around Ahangama. Tuk-tuk is the main means of transportation: it's a small three wheeled moped which does around 50 km/h. I think "This could totally work in Stockholm too, but running them on electricity instead of a gas engine". They're very convenient – there's always some tuk-tuk around to hail – and again very cheap. Like most urban Swedes, I'm a big fan of public transit. I love to get around on buses and subways. The public buses of Sri Lanka are a bit intimidating: with their huge wheels, they roar when they move through the traffic without mercy, vomiting out black exhaust gas. They slow down for a moment when people are getting on and off, which is done by literally jumping even though the bus hasn't stopped moving. We put the "Try The Bus" project on ice a while, until we know the society and surroundings better.

On the beach, I fall in love with the dish _roti_, which is a pancake style shell with filling on the inside. Actually, it can contain basically anything, like chicken or vegetables, like the French _crêpe_. We order them with bananas and chocolate sauce. The fruits are so fresh and sweet and cheap here – not a news flash, but still worth reiterating.

I have a hard time picking up any of the official languages spoken in Sri Lanka: Sinhalese and Tamil, with Sinhalese being the main one used on the south coast (all signs are in both languages). It's just very different from the Germanic and Romance languages. With English being the _lingua franca_ on the island, we certainly don't have a hard time communicating; it's more a matter of me having an urge to show respect to the locals by speaking a bit of their language. Next time here, perhaps I can nail a decent _"thank you"_ in Sinhalese.

One thing I notice, and something girlfriend explains further, is the sideways nod locals perform frequently. It's used for a bunch of things: for confirmation, positive feedback, as a greeting. Another connected thing I notice: people _touch_ me (in a good way) in everyday situations more than elsewhere I've been. Mostly people in service jobs, like waiters at restaurants, give me a light touch on the shoulders when greeting me or showing me to the table. After noticing it being a thing, I feel so good about it. So good, I vow to do it more often when at home and when it's appropriate (everybody in Sri Lanka pulled it off perfectly: 100% comfortable and natural situations).
