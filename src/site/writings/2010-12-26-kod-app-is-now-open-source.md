[ ![](http://kodapp.com/screenshot.png "Kod app") ](http://groups.google.com/group/kod-app/browse_thread/thread/8bc80d18932f5e99) [Kod app](http://kodapp.com/) is a promising code editor for OS X, created by the Swede (wohoo!) Rasmus Andersson. A bunch of features are promised, and the big news is that Rasmus today announced the project  [open sourced at Github](https://github.com/rsms/kod). Great stuff. There's also a [beta](http://kodapp.com/download) out if you want to try it out. I think it's awesome with a new simple, light-weight editor that's actually maintained. If Kod gets versatile, flexible, great features and highly customizable, I think we've got a player.
