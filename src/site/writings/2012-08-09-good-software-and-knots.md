_Warning: philosophical, almost silly, post about knots ahead_

While I was getting our sailing boat in order for a trip during the past weekend, I had an insight.

>

> Good software code is like a reliable knot

I was tying some ropes and it hit me how knots can be as beautiful, simple, messy and complex as code is.

- A good knot should be elegant but robust
- A good knot should be simple enough to understand and solve by another person
- The more complex the knot is, the more open it is to vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- Using existing knots which are proved to work in certain conditions is good
- A good knot in one situation may not be the optimal choice in another

Now switch _knot_ above to _piece of code_ or _software_.

I reckon you might be able to draw parallels about programming to many areas, but I think knots are one of the clearest comparisons.
