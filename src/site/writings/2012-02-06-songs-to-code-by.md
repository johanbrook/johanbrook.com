Music has a strong influence on a myriad of things. Art, writing, exercise, studying. It might help you focus, relax, cheer up. And most important: it could help you write badass code.

## Music I program to
I've set up a Spotify playlist where I collect great programming tunes. Mostly techno and other computer related genres.

I especially like the Tron soundtrack (who doesn't), Nine Inch Nails and Daft Punk. It's hard not to feel the kick when these epic melodies are doing their thing.
 
 Also check out the site who inspired this post: [Musicforprogramming();](http://musicforprogramming.net/). Free MP3 downloads. The [official Portal soundtrack](http://www.thinkwithportals.com/music.php) is also really, really cool.
 
 Other notable playlists to check out:
- ["Coding", by John Barbero Unenge](http://open.spotify.com/user/johnyboy991/playlist/3dWfwjPXtnPIykpe67pmL4)
- ["Work playlist", by Sebastiaan de With](http://open.spotify.com/user/caliform/playlist/2jFlbUqxF3wFt6G1Q2zr9S)

More suggestions on great programming songs are welcomed!
