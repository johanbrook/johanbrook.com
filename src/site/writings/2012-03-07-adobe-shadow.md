![Shadow](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/shadow/images/shadow_128x128.gif) Adobe takes a lot of crap for making half-assed attempts on winning back the favor of the HTML/CSS people, now when Flash probably has seen its glory days. But this Adobe Shadow looks really, really cool. 
 
 It's basically a tool for previewing your web designs on a mobile device, such as the iPad or iPhone. Your pair the device via a native app with your computer, and while your switching tabs and even writing new code, the web view will refresh automatically on the device. It looks incredibly handy. It even supports debugging with a web inspector on the mobile device (finally!), so you'll be able to pin down exactly what's happening on the other end. 
 
 Check out the [video demo](http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adobe-technology-sneaks-2012/adobe-shadow). I haven't tried it yet, but it's surely a nice idea of Adobe.
