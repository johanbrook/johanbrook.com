[ ![](http://sonspring.com/sites/default/files/formalize_cropped.png "Formalize") ](http://sonspring.com/journal/formalize-css) Some thorough work by Nathan Smith (creator of the [960 grid system](http://960.gs)) with the goal to remove inconsistencies between browsers and platforms. > I want some measure of control over form elements, without changing them so drastically as to appear foreign in a user’s operating system. Thus, my quest to find a happy medium, where browsers would generally agree and let me keep my sanity. The result is what I’m simply referring to as  [Formalize CSS](http://host.sonspring.com/formalize/).
It's some really good work he's done there, and I'll for sure take a closer look.
