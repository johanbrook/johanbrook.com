**In my [last post](http://www.johanbrook.com/writings/what-s-happened-so-far/)**, I wrote some words of what's happened in my life during the past year. I wrote about how I work remote in [Lookback](http://lookback.io), alongside other individuals spread out in the world. But what is remote work for us, exactly? How do I and we handle it? What trade-offs have we found? What are our tools? Here are my findings (no bragging, no preaching – just findings).

I'm sure there are lots of writings on the web about remote work. Many companies do it. I heard from somewhere that a minority of GitHub's workforce is working in the company's headquarters in San Francisco. Basecamp (formerly known as *37signals*) is also known to love remote work – so much they [wrote a book about it](http://37signals.com/remote/).

Why?!
