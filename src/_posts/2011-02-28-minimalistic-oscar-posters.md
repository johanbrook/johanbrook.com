David Lopez has created some great-looking movie posters of this year's Academy Award winning films. These kind of posters are easy to screw up, and hard to get "just right" where they are instantly recognized. Lopez's style is similar to the master [Olly Moss](http://ollymoss.com/). ![](http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles3/98146/projects/955899/9081a6706d79c3a53b8b95aeed35aab7.png "Black Swan")
