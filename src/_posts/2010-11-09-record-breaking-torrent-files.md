[ ![](http://torrentfreak.com/images/matrix%20ascii%20small.gif "Matrix ASCII") ](http://torrentfreak.com/5-torrent-files-that-broke-mind-boggling-records-101107/) TorrentFreak writes about five torrents which has broken memorial records. From the largest in size to the oldest but still alive today. I get warm and fuzzy over the geekiness of the oldest torrent: [The Matrix ASCII](http://onyx.chattanoogastate.edu/~jack/matrix/).
