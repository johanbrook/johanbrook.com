**I was born** in 1990 in a small village in central Sweden. Like many others, I gained an interest in computers through games and such. Unlike many others, I was pretty decent at both design and programming.

In 2009, I moved to Canada for a year. I worked and traveled, lived and visited Calgary and Vancouver. Spent a month in Hawaii. Back home again, I started freelancing in web design and gained a huge amount of experience when working with agencies and clients.

In 2011, I began studying software engineering at Chalmers in Gothenburg, Sweden. In university I grew enormously as a person (kind of like Johan 2.0) and had the best time in my life (so far).

However, life sometimes has unexpected events in store for you. In my case, it came when I worked with the startup Lookback during the summer of 2014. I ended up dropping out of university and joining Lookback on remote, and haven’t looked back since (pun intended).

In September 2015, I started traveling by doing this *nomad* thing. I hope to explore bits and pieces in the corners of the world, and learn to adapt to and integrate. [Give me a shout](http://twitter.com/johanbrook) if we're in the same town.
