                    ☑ ︎I've finished this book on <time datetime="2024-04-18T02:00:00+02:00">April 18</time>
                
            </p>
        </header>

        <div class="prose"><p>I liked &quot;Nattens Skola&quot;, and became quite immersed in it.</p>
<p>This is the fourth installment of Knausgård's &quot;Morgonstjärnan&quot; series. It's hard to say if it's a different universe from the other three books. The style is what Knausgård does best, but &quot;Nattens Skola&quot; contains more twists and turns than usual, and the main character is not that sympathetic at all, which is spelled out for us in the text quite early.</p>
<p>I tend to appreciate novels where there's a jump in time. I love to see the passing of time and how the author treats it with their characters. Here, the first part is in the 1980s, and the second part is 20 years later (the first part has been given the most space). It was also quite refreshing to put it in London instead of Norway.</p>
<p>In the other books, I had an easier time keeping up with the purpose of the text, whereas in this one, I constantly tried to look for underlying patterns (deeper than the obvious Faustian theme). Maybe I need to read some analytical texts from people smarter than me. Or, it's just &quot;less grand&quot; by design than book number one and three, in the way that there's less of the apocalyptical end-of-days vibe.</p>
<p>Further, all but one character from the protagonist's time in London in the 80s were discarded. One part of me appreciates that &quot;technique&quot;, where I as a reader shouldn't expect random people from the past coming back to the main character — this isn't how real life is anyway. So I was probably coloured by that sensational expectation that something like that would happen. In the end, Knausgård is superb at describing everyday interactions between people, which assembles the book's universe, so that's always a joy in itself.</p></div>
