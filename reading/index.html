Updated on Sunday, September 25th 2022.<table class=textual><tbody><tr><th>Title<th>Author<th>Notes<th title=Status><tr><td>Four Thousand Weeks<td class=f5>Oliver Burkeman<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6 comp-neon">Reading<tr><td>Att Uppfinna Världen ("Inventing the World")<td class=f5>Katrine Marçal<td class=f5>Historical account about how women have been pushed aside over the years when it comes to inventions and innovation.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6 comp-yellow">Paused<tr><td>Vargarna från evighetens skog<td class=f5>Karl Ove Knausgård<td class=f5>Prequel to "Morgonstjärnan" below.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6 comp-yellow">Paused<tr><td>Jack<td class=f5>Ulf Lundell<td class=f5><em>The</em> generational novel of the Swedish 1970s. Dropped it because it didn't really speak to me. I understand it must've been cool in the 70s, but not so now.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6 muted">Dropped<tr><td>Häng City<td class=f5>Mikael Yvesand<td class=f5>Lovely rendition of a summer in the lives of three 13 year old boys in northern Sweden in 1999. The language used is so very relatable, and so are the pop culture references. Even though "nothing" really happens, the book does describe (quite accurately) feelings, energies, places, activities, and personal traits of people from the eyes of a teenage boy.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Life<td class=f5>Keith Richards<td class=f5>The autobiography of Keith Richards (guitarist in Rolling Stones).<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Mastering the Art of French Cooking<td class=f5>Julia Child, Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle<td class=f5>I bought the Swedish translation as paperback, and read it all in once – back to back. Quite special for a cooking book. The book includes tips and tricks around techniques, equipment, and ingredients. All the traditional French recipies are in here. What I loved about the recipies was that they were both mechanic but yet very much alive. Meaning, the authors' obsession with details, experimentation, and iteration really shined through.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Morgonstjärnan<td class=f5>Karl Ove Knausgård<td class=f5>I thought Knausgård would be a hard read, but it was not. "Morgonstjärnan" is so lovely. The author has this superb power of making seemingly mundane everyday people and tasks become interesting. His description are rich, and the pace is perfect. I was really captivated and inspired.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Once Upon A Time… In Hollywood<td class=f5>Quentin Tarantino<td class=f5>It's quite rare that a book is written after a film, and by the film's creator too. I loved this one: it's 100% Quentin Tarantino-ness all way through. He has space to go deeper in the conversations between the characters, whose stories he can give justice too. Like the film, it somehow entertains me without having a real plot.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Clash<td class=f5>Strummer, Jones, Simonon, Headon<td class=f5>An okay account of the history of the band, told by themselves in interview format.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Ålevangeliet<td class=f5>Patrik Svensson<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6 muted">Dropped<tr><td>Fight Club<td class=f5>Chuck Palahniuk<td class=f5>I honestly think the movie is better. I'm sure the book would be cool if I'd read that first, but I couldn't stand the fast paced dialogue with random sentences thrown in between lines.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>American Psycho<td class=f5>Bret Easton Ellis<td class=f5>The book is a lot more psycho than the movie. More explicit than I thought. The unreliable monologues of the narrator are amazingly written, and there are more layers to the book than just the obvious one.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running<td class=f5>Haruki Murakami<td class=f5>I love Murakami's straight forward language. This one made me want to start running. He's very honest about himself in this semi-biography, but never sentimental. Feels very Japanese.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Samlade Verk<td class=f5>Lydia Sandgren<td class=f5>This is an epic describing the live of a couple of individuals from the 1970s until the 2010s in Gothenburg, Sweden. It really touched me, on several layers. I'm very sentimental about the city Gothenburg, and I was constantly impressed by the cultural references, the plot, and the language of the relatively young author. There's this amazing melancholia hanging over the whole work.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind<td class=f5>Shunryu Suzuki<td class=f5>It took me a long time to finish this very thin book. The language is dense, and I wanted to soak every page in. I had to re-read a couple of sentences. But I liked it as a whole, especially the laser focus of the author's message.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Ishmael<td class=f5>Daniel Quinn<td class=f5>A philosophical discourse about the evolution of homo sapiens. Some things are controversial, like population control. The book's dialogue is about biodiversity, climate change, urbanisation: a lot of contemporary topics. It's a nice pairing together with Sapiens.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Herakles<td class=f5>Theodor Kallifatides<td class=f5>I like mythology, especially like Greek mythology. This book is a novel – I guess a bit dramatised – about the life of the hero Hercules. It was good, very vivid and nuanced.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Normal People<td class=f5>Sally Rooney<td class=f5>I saw the series before reading the book, and both formats have their charm. The author has a great language, and manages to capture the atmosphere that surrounds that age from high school to university.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Cosa Nostra<td class=f5>John Dickie<td class=f5>A non-fiction history about the Sicilian mafia. Entertaining.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>About A Boy<td class=f5>Nick Hornby<td class=f5>Very 'fun' and unforeseeable language. The thoughts of the two main characters – the man and the boy – are written in a way that feels authentic. I liked the randomness and quick turns of the book.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Jag Kan Ha Fel<td class=f5>Björn Natthiko Lindeblad<td class=f5>Written by a Swedish businessman who became a Buddhist monk for 17 years. It's not a classic self help book, nor some kind of teaching about Buddhism. It's merely his story, with some of his philosophies thrown in. He mixes serious subjects with wit.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Godfather<td class=f5>Mario Puzo<td class=f5>Even better than the movie. More details (of course), and deeper descriptions of characters.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Alchemist<td class=f5>Paolo Coelho<td class=f5>I loved it in the beginning, but then it turned out to be boring New Age-y stuff.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Zahir<td class=f5>Paolo Coelho<td class=f5>Like The Alchemist, this one was boring. Poorly written, boring plot, and not believable at all.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Snow Leopard<td class=f5>Peter Matthiessen<td class=f5>A travel diary of an American in an expedition into the Himalayas. He's real goal is to catch a glimpse of the very shy Snow Leopard. This travel text captures the beauty of Zen without speaking too much about it. It's kind of dense at times, but very, very grand.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Men Without Women<td class=f5>Haruki Murakami<td class=f5>I like short story collections, and Murakami's language is the best. Read this.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Sun Also Rises<td class=f5>Ernest Hemingway<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>A Brief History of Time<td class=f5>Stephen Hawking<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>A Little Life<td class=f5>Hanya Yanagihara<td class=f5>The saddest book I've read in all my life. But oh so good.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>21 Lessons for the 21th Century<td class=f5>Yuval Noah Harari<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Hero – David Bowie<td class=f5>Lesley-Ann Jones<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Sapiens<td class=f5>Yuval Noah Harari<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Mountain Shadow<td class=f5>Gregory David Roberts<td class=f5>Sequel to Shantaram. Not as good, but nevertheless a good sequel.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>M Train<td class=f5>Patti Smith<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>A Moveable Feast<td class=f5>Ernest Hemingway<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Essential Hemingway<td class=f5>Ernest Hemingway<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Dancing with the Devil in the City of God<td class=f5>Juliana Barbassa<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Just Kids<td class=f5>Patti Smith<td class=f5>Very touching, and beautifully written.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance<td class=f5>Robert M. Pirsig<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>W. Axl Rose<td class=f5>Mick Wall<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Becoming Steve Jobs<td class=f5>Brent Schlender & Rick Tetzeli<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Steve Jobs<td class=f5>Walter Isaacson<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Shantaram<td class=f5>Gregory David Roberts<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Scar Tissue<td class=f5>Anthony Kiedis<td class=f5>Raw and honest.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Into the Wild<td class=f5>Jon Krakauer<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Black Sabbath<td class=f5>Mick Wall<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Road<td class=f5>Cormac McCarthy<td class=f5>The minimal language is perfect.<td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Life of Pi<td class=f5>Yann Martel<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Infinity<td class=f5>Brian Clegg<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Rework<td class=f5>Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail<td class=f5>Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh & Henry Lincoln<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>No One Here Gets Out Alive<td class=f5>Jerry Hopkins & Danny Sugarman<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Interview wih the Vampire<td class=f5>Anne Rice<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Led Zeppelin – When Giants Walked The Earth<td class=f5>Mick Wall<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Hammer of the Gods – The Led Zeppelin Saga<td class=f5>Stephen Davis<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Old Man and the Sea<td class=f5>Ernest Hemingway<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>1984<td class=f5>George Orwell<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>Animal Farm<td class=f5>George Orwell<td class=f5><td class="plain-font-features no-wrap f5 fw6"><tr><td>The Silmarillion<td class=f5>J.R.R.
