        <div class="prose"><p>I've finished the final installment of Knausgård's <em>Min Kamp</em> (<em>My Struggle</em>) autobiographical series. The full
collection of volumes goes over 3000 pages, so it suffices to say I'm pretty dazed now. Feels like I've been into
a tumble dryer and out again.<!--more--></p>
<p><em>Min Kamp</em> is an epic amount of work. It retells Knausgård's childhood, adolescence, university years, and
eventually becoming a father — this is over four decades of memories he accounts of in excruciating detail. This
pioneering style of writing, and of course the fact that he writes about real people without changing too many
names, was what made these novels unique.</p>
<p>I feel I can't accurately describe how I feel about the series, since English not being my mothertongue. I can only
praise the level of <em>detail and honesty</em> that has gone into the pages. I am no writer, but I appreciate honesty in
texts. Also have been a boy, teenager, a young adult, and now a father myself, I identify with areas and scenes
brought up over the six volumes, each describing encompassing chunks of Knausgård's life.</p>
<p>What's problematic, of course, with <em>Min Kamp</em> is that he writes about people being close to him, and since he's
being honest, it's not always positive things. His father, mother, brother, his then-wife, old girlfriends, old
colleagues are described in the way Knausgård sees them. It's <em>his</em> voice, <em>his</em> views. But he had to do it,
according to himself, in order to stay honest to the project.</p>
<p>What I'm most touched and deeply affected by in the end, is his and his then-wife Linda Boström Knausgård's story. It begins in the late 90s, and describes their relationship from being lovers in Stockholm to being a family with
three kids on the countryside of Skåne in south Sweden. He writes how Linda suffers from being bipolar,
which climaxes at the end of the sixth volume. It's almost like they became fictional figures for me, since I
wanted it to work out for them <em>so much</em> I forgot they're real people (they separated in 2016. <em>Sob</em>). Their years
together are described with such intimacy, which I think is required in order to make it honest and real. It made
me so empathetic towards both of them. The whole situation: Knausgårds need to write, Linda's mental condition,
their kids, their everyday life. I find myself being happy for them in the light moments, and sad in the dark
periods. They become real, because they <em>are</em> real.</p>
<p>Knausgård shows that every person's life is indeed &quot;interesting&quot; and is a well of experiences from which you can draw stories from. Even though he admits later that he wouldn't have done the project if he knew the
costs, I'm personally happy that he did, since it's a remarkable piece of work. Does he fully portray his wife
Linda's authentic inner self? No. Is it right to write about his dead father and grandmother in the way he does?
Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p>I've read quite many opinions about the series, and it's what you'd expect: much praise, but a lot of analysis
going on about ethics, chauvinism, and self-centerism (is that a word?). In the end, I was entertained and adore
Karl Ove Knausgård's style and angle.</p></div>
