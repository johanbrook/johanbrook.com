    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;hello world. this is me testing my new GUI for posting these small notes. i&#39;ll probably write a longer post about it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in a nutshell, i&#39;ve written a &lt;em&gt;barebones&lt;/em&gt; JS client to talk with GitHub&#39;s API to post a new file in this repo. no dependencies used. it was a fun challenge writing old school DOM JS manipulations again.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;i&#39;m coding together something that will let me write post and notes in my static site from anywhere, and it&#39;s super fun. need to deal with github auth and their api, learning about Cloudflare Workers, and extending lume as i go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the idea is to create a new post or note file with a request from an authed github session. not sure how generic i want to make this code ‚Äì it could be of use for others. the existing &amp;quot;CMSes&amp;quot; i&#39;ve seen for static pages are just &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;i&#39;ve rewrote my site (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumeland.github.io/&quot;&gt;lume&lt;/a&gt; üíõ) and made a ton of tweaks. classic neverending parental leave chores. it&#39;s built with &lt;a href=&quot;https://deno.land/&quot;&gt;deno&lt;/a&gt;, which I love even more. i&#39;m finally free from the node/npm APIs and build systems! everything is much simpler now, and i should probably write about it in the even more classic post of &amp;quot;i&#39;ve rewritten my blog&amp;quot; which usually shows up in January every year.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Summer is over, after vacation in August down on the Swedish west and south coasts. Weather was so-so, but it was nice with a change of scenery. We also spent the month of September in Florence, Italy, which was such a blast. We travelled abroad with our 10 months old daughter for the first time, and everything went quite well actually (I had expected the worst). I was so inspired by the stay in Italy, and hope I can bring some of that energy into the day-to-day life back in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I&#39;ll officially start my parental leave until April 2022. Scary but exciting. I&#39;m actually looking forward to just &lt;em&gt;not work&lt;/em&gt; for the first time in 7 years. Who knows what kind of person I&#39;ll be after this leave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by the book &amp;quot;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&amp;quot; by Haruki Murakami, so I want to start running this Autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&#39;d like to start making my own pasta. I took a pasta making course in Florence, and it was super fun. So simple! So fresh!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last day in the Swedish mountains, after a week of chilling and hiking. I wonder if I&#39;d like living here for longer periods of time, or if I&#39;d get cabin fever. I think I&#39;d adjust, but friends and family are far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still learning programming in Rust. Still not 100% sure of what I&#39;m doing when it comes to memory management, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/&quot;&gt;official guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.possiblerust.com/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Possible Rust&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; have been of huge help. Rust feels like a very &amp;quot;intellectual&amp;quot; language (sooo much language theory has gone into it!), but I&#39;m struck every day of how friendly the documentation and 3rd party writings on the language are. I think a super good way of learning Rust would be to actually pair program with some existing Rust programmer you know, in a non-trivial project. So that you can ask about all the small things you run into, and can be unblocked and learn forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to be on parental leave from October until ~April 2022. Am nervous, but looking forward. Will be a bit weird to be off work for 6 months since I started. But I have zero doubts in that I&#39;ll be able to chill in the new role of being a parent 100% of the time. I&#39;ll miss coding for work though, BUT I guess I&#39;ll need to find myself a sIdE PrOjEct like everybody else?!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
