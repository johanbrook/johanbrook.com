      <p>Updated on <strong>January 30th, 2022</strong> from Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<h2>Since the last update…</h2>
<p>…I've more than half way through my parental leave with the daughter. It's been very, very good so far. I've <em>so</em> been enjoying just being free to hang with the kid, and take each day in our own pace. The only challenge has been to actually come up with stuff to do on a rainy day, but somehow it's been sorting itself out. We've spent time in the library, flea market, strolling in the city, at museums, and to be honest: in shopping malls. I've had <em>zero</em> stress during these activities (except for the kid has made a fuss). I've really felt I've had the time to enjoy things, and not having to force them into evenings and weekends. So the sheer amount of time has been very good for me. It's been a solid "brain reset" since you gain so many new perspectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>on the importance of human contact.</li>
<li>on the non-importance of working too much.</li>
<li>on the habit of doing weekly planning if you're a family with children.</li>
<li>on the significance of keeping up an exercise schedule.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Travelling</h2>
<p>I'm very ready for doing more travelling this year. We went to Italy in September for a month, and it was amazing. I hope we can do more of those things. A dream would be to try to be away for a longer period of time, at least 2-3 months. Perhaps in Europe. As a preparation for living abroad for a full year sometime later. Anyhow, start small.</p>
<h2>Exercising</h2>
<p>I've been going back to the gym after a holiday break, and try to keep up the nutrient goals (the protein, man). I bought myself new runner shoes in November and been running at least twice a week since. I <em>think</em> I'm starting to feel that urge to run if I haven't for a few days. Lifting weights and running are activities I see as two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>They both have goals, such as "lift <em>X</em> amount of kilograms in the chest press" and "run 10 kilometers".</li>
<li>They are also wellness projects, as a preventive measure for me not … dying of bad cholesterol :) Running also famously clears the head in some magical way.</li>
</ol>
<p>I find running is easier to just power through. Lifting weights includes breaks, focus, and short bursts of energy. Running is this monotone steam train just going on and on. The latter is interesting in the way one can manipulate the energy during the exercise, so that one can rest (!) when running at a lower pace but still keep moving forward. There's no way I can rest when doing deadlifts in the gym.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, they complement each other very nicely.</p>
<h2>Currently reading</h2>
<p>See <a href="/reading">"Reading"</a>.</p>
<p>I'm reading <em>"Killing Commendatore"</em> by Haruki Murakami at the moment, but I find it pretty slow. So far, I like his short story collections better (such as <em>"Men Without Women"</em>).</p>
<h2>Habits to keep</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep off Instagram.</li>
<li>Keep off Facebook.</li>
<li>Keep going to the gym.</li>
<li>Keep reading books.</li>
<li>Keep doing running.</li>
<li>Keep writing (<a href="/mind">/mind</a> is an experiment about this).</li>
<li>Leave phone out of the bedroom. I've got a new <a href="https://de.braun-clocks.com/collections/analogue-clocks/products/bc22-braun-classic-analogue-alarm-clock-white">bedside alarm clock from Braun</a> for checking the time instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aspirations for 2022</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spend as much time as I can with my daughter.</li>
<li>Travel and challenge ourselves as parents to get out of comfort zones.</li>
<li>Continue to develop this site's looks and content.</li>
</ul>

<p>If my life changes, I'll update this page. Also see <a href="/mind">what's on my mind</a>.</p>
