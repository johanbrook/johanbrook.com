        <![CDATA[After reading mr. Knausgård's pieces for months, I felt a need for reading something by mrs. Boström Knausgård.
        
        Her prose is beautiful and honest. The book describes her time at a psychiatric ward, where she's going through electric shock treatment, which is a horrible way to "cure" bipolar disorder. Further, she retells fragments from her youth and marriage to Karl Ove Knausgård (where he's the "you" in the text).
        
        It's a very vulnerable text, dripping of anger towards the system in Sweden, and sadness over the detoriation of her marriage and subsequent divorce. Both subjects hurt to read in different ways.
        
        There's no way getting away from that there's a darkness laid over the whole text, and I put it down with a stint of melancholia but also empathy towards Linda Boström Knausgård. After it was over, I just wanted her to be happy.

        <![CDATA[I liked "Nattens Skola", and became quite immersed in it.
        
        This is the fourth installment of Knausgård's "Morgonstjärnan" series. It's hard to say if it's a different universe from the other three books. The style is what Knausgård does best, but "Nattens Skola" contains more twists and turns than usual, and the main character is not that sympathetic at all, which is spelled out for us in the text quite early.
        
        I tend to appreciate novels where there's a jump in time. I love to see the passing of time and how the author treats it with their characters. Here, the first part is in the 1980s, and the second part is 20 years later (the first part has been given the most space). It was also quite refreshing to put it in London instead of Norway.
        
        In the other books, I had an easier time keeping up with the purpose of the text, whereas in this one, I constantly tried to look for underlying patterns (deeper than the obvious Faustian theme). Maybe I need to read some analytical texts from people smarter than me. Or, it's just "less grand" by design than book number one and three, in the way that there's less of the apocalyptical end-of-days vibe.
        
        Further, all but one character from the protagonist's time in London in the 80s were discarded. One part of me appreciates that "technique", where I as a reader shouldn't expect random people from the past coming back to the main character — this isn't how real life is anyway. So I was probably coloured by that sensational expectation that something like that would happen. In the end, Knausgård is superb at describing everyday interactions between people, which assembles the book's universe, so that's always a joy in itself.

        <![CDATA[I've finished the final installment of Knausgård's _Min Kamp_ (_My Struggle_) autobiographical series. The full
        collection of volumes goes over 3000 pages, so it suffices to say I'm pretty dazed now. Feels like I've been into
        a tumble dryer and out again.<!--more-->
        
        _Min Kamp_ is an epic amount of work. It retells Knausgård's childhood, adolescence, university years, and
        eventually becoming a father — this is over four decades of memories he accounts of in excruciating detail. This
        pioneering style of writing, and of course the fact that he writes about real people without changing too many
        names, was what made these novels unique.
        
        I feel I can't accurately describe how I feel about the series, since English not being my mothertongue. I can only
        praise the level of _detail and honesty_ that has gone into the pages. I am no writer, but I appreciate honesty in
        texts. Also have been a boy, teenager, a young adult, and now a father myself, I identify with areas and scenes
        brought up over the six volumes, each describing encompassing chunks of Knausgård's life.
        
        What's problematic, of course, with _Min Kamp_ is that he writes about people being close to him, and since he's
        being honest, it's not always positive things. His father, mother, brother, his then-wife, old girlfriends, old
        colleagues are described in the way Knausgård sees them. It's _his_ voice, _his_ views. But he had to do it,
        according to himself, in order to stay honest to the project.
        
        What I'm most touched and deeply affected by in the end, is his and his then-wife Linda Boström Knausgård's story. It begins in the late 90s, and describes their relationship from being lovers in Stockholm to being a family with
        three kids on the countryside of Skåne in south Sweden. He writes how Linda suffers from being bipolar,
        which climaxes at the end of the sixth volume. It's almost like they became fictional figures for me, since I
        wanted it to work out for them _so much_ I forgot they're real people (they separated in 2016. _Sob_). Their years
        together are described with such intimacy, which I think is required in order to make it honest and real. It made
        me so empathetic towards both of them. The whole situation: Knausgårds need to write, Linda's mental condition,
        their kids, their everyday life. I find myself being happy for them in the light moments, and sad in the dark
        periods. They become real, because they _are_ real.
        
        Knausgård shows that every person's life is indeed "interesting" and is a well of experiences from which you can draw stories from. Even though he admits later that he wouldn't have done the project if he knew the
        costs, I'm personally happy that he did, since it's a remarkable piece of work. Does he fully portray his wife
        Linda's authentic inner self? No. Is it right to write about his dead father and grandmother in the way he does?
        Maybe, maybe not.
        
        I've read quite many opinions about the series, and it's what you'd expect: much praise, but a lot of analysis
        going on about ethics, chauvinism, and self-centerism (is that a word?). In the end, I was entertained and adore
        Karl Ove Knausgård's style and angle.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is kind of a "dramatised" documentary of actual events. Tons of historical metadata along the way. It's a bit cheesy sometimes, but I totally admit it was a page turner. And most importantly, it taught me a lot about the real life behind the Wall, in East Berlin (hint: Stasi were the biggest assholes ever).]]></content:encoded>
