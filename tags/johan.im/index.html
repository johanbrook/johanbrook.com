<h2>Layout</h2>
<p>I still go with the two-column layout. This time, I fully ditched any 12 or 16 column grids, and
went fluid all the way, i.e. I've made all measures relative to each other, and the Golden Ratio.
I've used a 6pt baseline grid, and a <a href="http://modularscale.com/">modular scale</a>. It was actually
quite relaxing 'letting go' of the old grids and start fresh.</p></div>

others, but soon enough you'll need your fix. My site is always in constant redesign mode, with a
goal to not have to make another redesign. Actually when it comes to site redesigns, I think it’s
quite incorrect to call it <em>a redesign</em>. Quite blurry, to be honest. To <em>realign</em> the elements
sounds better to me – to take a look at the old site and ask yourself: “What’s working in this
design, and what’s not?”. It’s a constant iteration thing, and I’ve tried to bring the elements and
concepts I liked the most from the old design into this one.</p></div>

                    <div class="prose excerpt f5"><p>Sigh. I wasn't happy with the last one. Overly complex and not straight to the point. So I sat down
one evening, pretty casual, and I created something. I continued to experiment and in two days I had
created a completely new look, and I liked it. This one features a more cleaner layout (responsive,
of course) and clearer typography. I've put more attention to quickies I post and made some
improvements to the HTML markup. But, the breaking news is the
<a href="http://johanbrook.com/work">work page</a>. I've finally put together something similar to a portfolio,
although it's pretty humble. You're welcomed to have a look. For Swedish readers I've created a
<a href="http://jobbamed.johanbrook.com">micro-site promoting me and my skills</a>. It's in Swedish, but the
design is pretty slick (the markup is <em>sexy</em>). Thanks for dropping by, and enjoy the new appearance.
I hope I get some more motivation to write some more journal posts now ...</p></div>

                    <div class="prose excerpt f5"><p>Hi and welcome to my new personal site. I've finally been able to get out of the six months long
swamp known as &quot;creative block&quot;, &quot;problems deciding&quot; and &quot;lack of time&quot;. I'm a boy man of perfection
and innovation and we all know that we are our own's worst client. This new site features a journal
(with posts and quickies), a work sample page, an about page with services and contact info. The
previous designs were quite ambitious, and were sort of &quot;too big&quot; for me. It took a couple of
iterations for me to realize that I didn't need an XXL site. Just a place for writing, showing off
my work and contact info would be fine. I'm quite embarrassed sitting here in October with  a site I
planned to launch in March, but I've learnt a lot during the process.</p></div>
