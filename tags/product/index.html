<blockquote>
<p>What killed us was “one more thing.” We could have easily done three major releases that year if
we had drawn a line in the sand, said “finished,” and shipped the darn thing. The problem is that
the longer it’s been since your last release the more pressure and anticipation there is, so
you’re more likely to try to slip in just one more thing or a fix that will make a feature really
shine. For some projects, this literally goes on forever. I think it's really important just to
create things and get into the game. It creates a feel of productivity, rather than having 5-10
half-assed ideas laying around, making you feel bad and stresses you out for not doing anything
with them. When I'm having ideas for stuff I want to do, I can't think of anything else during
that time. Only when I start creating, and maybe quite it when realizing that it wasn't what I
expected, I've got good conscience. In most cases, it's just a matter of creating a product that
does ONE thing really well, and then build upon that:</p>

<p>Google can’t reduce scope like Instagram did. Instagram started out as being a far different

just photographs. But, they learned they couldn’t complete such a grand vision and do it well. So
they kept throwing out features. Instagram can do that. Robert Scoble on why it would be difficult
