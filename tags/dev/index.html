<p>I started programming in Java and PHP. Those two worlds were vastly different. PHP stood for
freedom, fun, and anything-is-possible. Java was rigid, hard, and verbose – much because of the need
for <em>types</em> everywhere. However, when I got the Java code to compile, it was <em>usually</em> okay in
runtime (as okay it can be for a 15 year old). Java was heavily used in university, and I grew to
hate it even more. The interpreted languages like PHP, Ruby, and Javascript felt much nicer.</p></div>

<p>During parental leave, I've started to run. Not away from the baby, for heaven's sakes, but regular
exercise running. I really prioritised keeping it super straight-forward: I refuse wear any kind of
wearable, such an Apple Watch or Garmin in order to track heart rate and so on (I won't go into why
here, I just don't need another tech device). But. Even I see the need for tracking basic stats,
like duration, length of run, and average speed. Those are literally the three things I need.</p></div>

communicate their ideas. By writing clear comments and technical specs, they let other programmers
understand their code, which means other programmers can use and work with their code instead of
rewriting it. Absent this, their code is worthless. By writing clear technical documentation for end
users, they allow people to figure out what their code is supposed to do, which is the only way
those users can see the value in their code. Joel Spolsky</p></div>

<p>Almost everybody begins OOP with this misconception - objects in real world directly map to OOP
objects. Its maybe a good place to start but how many grow up from the initial simplistic rule -
map nouns in requirements to classes. So, you end up with objects that don't really mean anything
and don't do much. Naive use of UML diagrams also leads to this. Discovering abstractions is
tricky. One needs to really live with requirements inside out before they present themselves. From
a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5336588">Hacker News comment</a> on 
<a href="http://www.lispcast.com/java-learn-from-clojure?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">this story about Clojure programming</a>.
I've seen this myself in school, where we've gone through endless examples of OOP where the
classes were a Ball, a Car, a Zebra, or other overused objects in the real world. The thing is,
most programming isn't about modeling the real world, <em>our</em> world. When writing code you're free
to do things your way, not being tied to the constraints of the real world thinking.</p>

<p>Programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill. Learning about &quot;for&quot; loops is not learning to
program, any more than learning about pencils is learning to draw. Bret Victor's essay on
&quot;Learnable Programming&quot; is a really solid piece on how improvements can be made when creating
tools and techniques to learn how to program. I love the amount of detail and work he's put down
in the article. It's not a secret that Victor has huge insights in this area – I'm especially fond
of his <a href="http://worrydream.com/Tangle/">Tangle Javascript library</a> and the article
<a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/">&quot;Ladder of Abstraction&quot;</a>.</p>

we (a group of four people) built an application for grocery shopping, aimed towards elderly people.
The tools were quite horrible: Java, Swing, Netbeans, and the currently deprecated Swing Application
Framework. In two weeks, a working prototype had to be finished, and for freshmen who just had taken
an autumn of two introductory courses in Java, it seemed a bit harsh. After all, the course is about
&quot;GUI design&quot; – that doesn't ring very well together with &quot;Java&quot; and &quot;Swing&quot;.</p></div>

<p>For some projects, a hybrid method of producing a type of scratch file, with a general overview of
the style and colours of the app/website, then going straight into HTML/CSS has worked, in others, I
still need to produce full-scale visuals. <strong>I recognize the things</strong> she brings up in her post.
Everytime I've gone straight to the browser to create something quick for myself, the result is an
incomprehensible mess. Perhaps I'm not good enough yet, but my brain just isn't in &quot;creative mode&quot;
when I'm coding. Everything gets more bulky when you're doing major changes (that is, not subtle
colour changes, but numerous layout experiments, for instance). Doing layout changes in Photoshop?
Just drag that box over there. Doing it in HTML/CSS? Um, just make that box <code>float: left;</code> , and
clear that container, then .. .</p></div>

nifty tools and techniques, as well as other blog posts describing pitfalls and other general tips.
Google around for something like _&quot;setting up web development environment os x&quot;. _Two gems are

and hated among serious new-era web developers. The familiar C style syntax is becoming old, there's
a lot of noise in the code, and a lot more pet peeves which are forcing developers to other
languages, such as Ruby, Python, and in recent days Javascript.</p></div>

JavaScript is with its user interface: its syntax. The inability to quickly improve its syntax has
lead to the language’s downfall. If you have to read a single article on Javascript this month; make
it this one. Insightful, nitty-gritty computer science-y stuff is promised (don't worry about the
overly dramatic title). Lots of great musings, code samples, history, and suggestions on
improvements of Javascript, and also about the state of compilers such as CoffeeScript. &gt; Since
CoffeeScript compilers are in the hands of developers rather than the visitors to sites, you control
which version of CoffeeScript you are using. You can upgrade at will. This also means CoffeeScript
does not need to be standardized and go through the subsequent painfully slow growth of a
standardized language. CoffeeScript can grow at the rate of its community’s imagination and desire.
JavaScript standardization was essential to the success of the web but the same constraints do not
apply to CoffeeScript. (I also recommend checking out more of Peter's articles. Some really good
stuff in there).</p></div>

                    <div class="prose excerpt f5"><p>Documenting code is important, and I think Zach successfully explains <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> in his post. I
often find documenting code quite tricky, since it forces you to make it really clear and concise.
It challenges you to write good code, since another guy is supposed to understand how everything
works from reading the docs. &quot;Can I scrap this method? Do I have to refactor? Is this too tightly
coupled?&quot;. When you're documenting, you might see the obvious flaws in the code flow, and it's a
win-win.</p></div>

on hosted Wordpress.com blogs for quite some time, and available as a plugin as well. At first I
deactivated the bar at once, but later I realized it's pretty handy to have around. I usually make
my own admin menus for quick access to stats, new posts and more, but the official admin bar is more
versatile (I'm using the Wordpress function <code>current_user_can(&quot;manage_options&quot;)</code> in an if-statement
to show the admin menu only to me).

Anyway, how about customizing the admin bar? You know: add stuff, style stuff. Plugins and themes
may add their own menus to the bar, as with the Wordpress.com Stats plugin I'm using, for instance.
A small graph is shown in the bar if you've got the plugin installed, with a link to the admin stats
page. Neat – as you see on the screenshot above it also shows the shortlink to the current
page/post. The rendering of the bar itself builds upon a simple API you can hook into, but I haven't
found any documentation in the Wordpress Codex yet though, so I'm gonna show some simple examples
from what I've picked up from the Wordpress core. First we need a hook. The Wordpress developers
advise us to use <code>admin_bar_menu</code> . Right on. Add this to <code>functions.php</code> :</p></div>

on the permalink structure you've set up on your local installation either (which means creating

same color you would just have to type <code>border: 1px solid;</code> . The border-color inherits from the
paragraphs <code>color</code> property. How about using your element's color value for other things than
border-colors? A neat CSS keyword I didn't know about makes this possible: <code>currentcolor</code> . Treat it
as any other color keyword (like red, blue, green etc.) and wherever it's used, the color of the

highlighting and plugin features appeals a lot to me, as well as the clever address field in the
app, which lets you edit any text file you know the URL for – local or remote. Textmate is great,
but it's not that maintained and up-to-date. A lightweight, customizable, community developed code
editor like Kod would help a lot. Go check out <a href="http://github.com/rsms/kod">Kod's Github page</a> and

<p>What does Google have to gain from dropping H.264? Nothing at face value; it’s all to do with
preventing H.264 from becoming the <em>de facto</em> standard for “Video on the Web”, not realizing
that <em>it already is</em>. Perhaps Google made this move to try and dethrone H.264, but to that end, I
have but one question: Why do it in a way that hurts your users when time itself would sort that
out automatically? Faruk Ateş' great write-up on the situation with Google's rejection of the
H.264 codec in Chrome. It's one thing to invent a new codec or format, put it in your browser and
lobby for other vendors and manufacturers to support it. But Google has completely shut off any
chance for H.264 to be a really great standard for video on the internet. The author put it: &quot;Time
will take care of this itself&quot;, which is quite obvious. VHS took care of Betamax, Blueray took
care of HD-DVD. &gt; If that’s really why they did it, and that’s <em>all</em> it is, then harming users in
the process is a poor decision in my opinion. Especially since that very same goal could have been
accomplished with just a little waiting.</p>

so on. Here's an example of the new syntax for a linear gradient:</p></div>

techniques: <a href="http://hardboiledwebdesign.com">Hardboiled Web Design</a>. I also recommend
the accompanying  <a href="http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/talk/">slides</a>.</p>

<p>But the ugly truth is that the average Joe Client simply doesn’t care. Joe is looking not for a

excited about their beloved web standards and semantics. Clients want great looking web sites that
accomplish their goals. We should however use standards in order to achieve that – a well written,
compatible, usable, accessible, future-proof web site. The post brings up exactly that: how we
need to explain to the client how the underlying code and the designer's excessive relationship to

biggest factor).</p>

                    <div class="prose excerpt f5"><p>Gruber just posted a link to an interview of Ryan Singer from 37signals, where Singer mentioned a
mobile HTML5 framework. That's pretty big stuff – Ruby on Rails is doing pretty good, and a mobile
framework in the same style would be quite awesome, since it according to Singer uses Coffeescript –
a way more human friendly, Ruby like style of writing Javascript (a programmer friend of mine is
totally in love with it). We've got a lot of Javascript frameworks for mobile devices these days.
The first one I got in touch with (no pun intended, promise) was <a href="http://jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a> – a
simple and stylish jQuery framework mainly for iOS. That one evolved into
<a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">Sencha Touch</a> (now based on Ext.js), and the jQuery group
themselves recently released <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> with support for a lot of
phones and operating systems. Two more heavy-weight guys are
<a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/">Sproutcore</a> and <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a>. Isn't the market
over-saturated soon? Will this mobile framework by 37signals become just one in a million, or might
it be &quot;the one&quot;? Before everybody go nuts, it's worth noting that
<a href="http://twitter.com/sstephenson">Sam Stephenson</a> (37signals, creator of Prototype.js) stated this in
a comment on the interview:</p></div>

Tower is an upcoming Mac client for the Git versioning system, and it looks good. I'm still a noob
on Git, so I guess I would find it very useful, and maybe even power users in large projects would
too. Anyhow I think it's great that it exists a native client for Mac – like
<a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> for MySQL databases. Choice is good. The command line
doesn't always cut it, and web based is ... yeah, web based. It doesn't say if it's paid or free,
but the developers are on Twitter ( <a href="http://twitter.com/gittower">@gittower</a>), and Tower is coming
this November.</p></div>

betrayal and markup. He talks about the simplicity in HTML5 (the doctype!) and how we can solve the

Some thorough work by Nathan Smith (creator of the <a href="http://960.gs">960 grid system</a>) with the goal
to remove inconsistencies between browsers and platforms. &gt; I want some measure of control over form
elements, without changing them so drastically as to appear foreign in a user’s operating system.
Thus, my quest to find a happy medium, where browsers would generally agree and let me keep my
sanity. The result is what I’m simply referring to as 
<a href="http://host.sonspring.com/formalize/">Formalize CSS</a>. It's some really good work he's done there,
and I'll for sure take a closer look.</p></div>

Eric Butler has written a Firefox extension which sniffs all connections made to insecure websites
inside your current WiFi area. You can even double click on the identities in the sidebar and log in
as them. Totally freaky. &gt; HTTP session hijacking (sometimes called &quot;sidejacking&quot;) is when an
attacker gets a hold of a user's cookie, allowing them to do anything the user can do on a
particular website. On an open wireless network, cookies are basically shouted through the air,
making these attacks extremely easy. This is a widely known problem that has been talked about to
death, yet very popular websites continue to fail at protecting their users. The only effective fix
for this problem is full end-to-end encryption, known on the web as HTTPS or SSL.</p></div>

<p>As of the release of Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 3, the version of Java that is ported by Apple,
and that ships with Mac OS X, is deprecated. This means that the Apple-produced runtime will not
be maintained at the same level, and may be removed from future versions of Mac OS X. The Java
runtime shipping in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, and Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, will continue to be
supported and maintained through the standard support cycles of those products. Was just a matter
of time, if you ask me.</p>

<p>If someone claims to have the perfect programming language, he is either a fool or a salesman or
both In 1985 Bjarne Stroustrup created the C++ programming language, much because of his and his
colleague's frustration with C. Today C++ is everywhere and is in my opinion the mainstream and
&quot;godfather language&quot; for beginners to get accustomed with. I remember my excitement and interest
when I got a &quot;Learn To Program C++ in 24 Hours&quot; book for Christmas once. Then picture my
excitement when I, Johan, wrote – <em>created</em> – my first usable program (a Celsius-Fahrenheit
converter). Long live C++.</p>
