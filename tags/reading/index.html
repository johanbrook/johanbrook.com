<p>My father in law borrowed me this one, not without a glimpse in his eye. It's hard to describe this
novel. It's not what it seems to be in the first few pages, which is about a man who starts talking
with a gorilla via telepathy. The bulk of the novel is the philosophical conversation between the
odd couple, where the gorilla acts as the teacher for the man, who acts as narrator.</p></div>
