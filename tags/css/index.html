virtual DOM, like React, to translate app state to user interface. Add a dash of TypeScript, and
you've got a really nice and tight web frontend setup.</p></div>

<p>For some projects, a hybrid method of producing a type of scratch file, with a general overview of
the style and colours of the app/website, then going straight into HTML/CSS has worked, in others, I
still need to produce full-scale visuals. <strong>I recognize the things</strong> she brings up in her post.
Everytime I've gone straight to the browser to create something quick for myself, the result is an
incomprehensible mess. Perhaps I'm not good enough yet, but my brain just isn't in &quot;creative mode&quot;
when I'm coding. Everything gets more bulky when you're doing major changes (that is, not subtle
colour changes, but numerous layout experiments, for instance). Doing layout changes in Photoshop?
Just drag that box over there. Doing it in HTML/CSS? Um, just make that box <code>float: left;</code> , and
clear that container, then .. .</p></div>

straight-forward version, but since I'm using <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> with its mixins, it's not
a huge deal. In a blog post posted today, the Webkit team describes a new simpler gradient syntax.
The old one dealt with percent values, it wasn't very liberal with the order of the arguments, and
so on. Here's an example of the new syntax for a linear gradient:</p></div>

Some thorough work by Nathan Smith (creator of the <a href="http://960.gs">960 grid system</a>) with the goal
to remove inconsistencies between browsers and platforms. &gt; I want some measure of control over form
elements, without changing them so drastically as to appear foreign in a user’s operating system.
Thus, my quest to find a happy medium, where browsers would generally agree and let me keep my
sanity. The result is what I’m simply referring to as 
<a href="http://host.sonspring.com/formalize/">Formalize CSS</a>. It's some really good work he's done there,
and I'll for sure take a closer look.</p></div>
