methodologies (like Continous Delivery, Continous Integration) invented to deal with the pain points
associated with shipping. Hell, there are even roles (devops, sysops) for easening the burden of
moving code from one system to another. Why, oh why are we conscious and sometimes afraid of
shipping our work?</p></div>

monopath. It means a person with a narrow mind, a one-track brain, a bore, a super-specialist, an
expert with no other interests — in other words, the role-model of choice in the Western world.
Great text about things I've written or linked to before: how being wide in your interests and
learning really is a great way of living. Personally, I am able to connect things that I
previously thought were separate, building bridges between areas, and seeing things in a larger
perspective, giving me a deeper understanding of the subject and thus a unique satisfaction with
what I am currently doing.</p>

                    <div class="prose excerpt f5"><p>The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming
languages they know, and it’s not whether they prefer Python or Java. It’s whether they can
communicate their ideas. By writing clear comments and technical specs, they let other programmers
understand their code, which means other programmers can use and work with their code instead of
rewriting it. Absent this, their code is worthless. By writing clear technical documentation for end
users, they allow people to figure out what their code is supposed to do, which is the only way
those users can see the value in their code. Joel Spolsky</p></div>

Valve really is. I've heard about it's modern thinking about management, but didn't think it was
this flat. It could either go super good or really bad (as we know, it's the former) – it feels
like an experiment similar to &quot;The Animal Farm&quot; or something.</p>

Framework. In two weeks, a working prototype had to be finished, and for freshmen who just had taken
an autumn of two introductory courses in Java, it seemed a bit harsh. After all, the course is about

<p>I’ve known fabulous programmers flame out in the quizzing cage and terrible ones excel. So unless
you’re specifically hiring someone to design you the next sorting algorithm, making them do so on
the white board is a poor gauge of future success. I've read many articles on this subject: how to
ace an interview for a developer position. Even for front-end positions, questions about
algorithms and similar &quot;puzzles&quot; arise. Sorry, but I actually think you have to tailor the
interview material for the practical assignments the interviewee will receive.</p>

<p>Mark Otto brings up an interesting subject: how to widen your horizon into other areas than your
main focus. He reference to a model of a 'T' letter, where your skills sit in in the vertical
columns. The title of his post, &quot;Fatten Up Those T's&quot;, describes how you should make your own T
fatter by learning new things. This is a theory I like. I've always been interested in a lot of
stuff – from pure graphic design to back-end code. I refuse to believe that you have to be a
specialist in order to land great jobs and gigs. Since there's a myriad of web technologies
available today, the demand for über specialized people aren't that high. Imagine a pure designer
person today. No HTML or CSS knowledge, and absolutely no Javascript skills whatsoever. I don't know
about you, but I would think twice before hiring that person:</p></div>

                    <div class="prose excerpt f5"><p>A while ago I was visiting a relative/client regarding some counseling about her brand new Wordpress
site. While being there she mentioned some flyers she and her husband had made for the business
(garden services). Since spring is coming along you've got to ramp up quickly now because of the
huge demand later on, therefore the need for a flyer just to &quot;get it out there&quot;. I have to say I had
loved to design it myself – no doubt – but then I saw the flyer they had created. I really liked it
and was impressed. It was an elegant gallery of garden photos on portrait piece of paper, with the
logotype in the middle. I think it was 3x6 small photos ordered in a grid. To be honest, I couldn't
have made it better myself. I believe the moral of the story is that everybody can design. It just
has to be simple enough. If I was to design that flyer, I had started to decide on typography,
grids, hierarchy, colour scheme, what kind of photos to use, etc. I had <em>given it too much thought</em>
and bypassed the really simple, straight-forward and plain beautiful solution. It's important to
take a step back as a designer (and developer as well) and think of what you're doing. Is it really
crucial and vital that the text lines up perfectly to the horizontal grid? Is it worth it to rewrite
a large part of the application just to make use of that cool library? &quot;Regular&quot; people (if I may
say so) aren't always dumb users who have no idea of what they want. When I was young and foolish I
used to be so very eager to build stuff that I didn't care too much about asking people (and myself)
what really mattered the most with this application/design. I ended up feeling like I had missed
something. Of course there are boundaries where you actually shouldn't consult end-users, focus
groups and so on. But what I mean is that it's quite good to step away from the designer/developer
role and get back to the roots sometimes. Everybody will gain from it.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>What killed us was “one more thing.” We could have easily done three major releases that year if
we had drawn a line in the sand, said “finished,” and shipped the darn thing. The problem is that
the longer it’s been since your last release the more pressure and anticipation there is, so
you’re more likely to try to slip in just one more thing or a fix that will make a feature really
shine. For some projects, this literally goes on forever. I think it's really important just to
create things and get into the game. It creates a feel of productivity, rather than having 5-10
half-assed ideas laying around, making you feel bad and stresses you out for not doing anything
with them. When I'm having ideas for stuff I want to do, I can't think of anything else during
that time. Only when I start creating, and maybe quite it when realizing that it wasn't what I
expected, I've got good conscience. In most cases, it's just a matter of creating a product that
does ONE thing really well, and then build upon that:</p>

of their real-time chat application, Campfire, experienced downtimes and overall unstable behavior.
Not being able to access web applications sucks, and especially if you're a paying customer and your
daily business life depends on it. But shit happens, right? This can happen to the best (customers
of Apple's MobileMe weren't that happy in the initial shaky stages). What's dead important and
actually good act in your favor is how you handle the crisis. In the linked article Jason Fried
tells us a little bit about how they communicated with their customers during the downtime. They
used <em>real</em> words for this real problem, not corporate talk. They wrote a blog post explaining
exactly what had happened and what measures they took to make sure it wouldn't happen again. As the
title of the article says, they turned this negative event to further show their customers how much
they care.</p></div>

impossible for them to get up for the early classes. Other guys and girls couldn’t stay up too late

superb post. It describes the position in detail – by reading it I know exactly what the position is
all about, and what's expected from me. I get an insight in their work process and understand what
they are looking for. But the most beautiful thing was near the bottom. Jason Fried put it: &gt; It
doesn’t matter where you went to school, or if you even graduated. It doesn’t matter if this is your
first job or your fifth. Doing great work and being driven to improve yourself and everything you
touch is what matters. That's what's all about. When employers demand experience and/or education,
they put up hinders for the applicant. Energy is drained on polishing (lying in) your resume (at
least early in your career), and that energy could be used for doing work to put together a great
portfolio instead. That paragraph made it totally clear to me.</p></div>
