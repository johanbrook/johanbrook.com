<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Food">Slow Food</a> equivalent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the Fast Web? It’s the out of control web. The oh my god there’s so much stuff and I can’t
possibly keep up web. It’s the spend two dozen times a day checking web. The in one end out the
other web. The web designed to appeal to the basest of our intellectual palettes, the salt, sugar
and fat of online content web. It’s the scale hard and fast web. The create a destination for
billions of people web. The you have two hundred twenty six new updates web. Keep up or be lost.
Click me. Like me. Tweet me. Share me. The Fast Web demands that you do things and do them now.
The author brings up Instapaper as an example of a Slow Web product: I may be stretching my
analogy a bit here, but it’s kind of like boxing up a meal and putting it away in the fridge for
when you’re hungry, except in this case, it doesn’t lose as much of its taste. I've actually
thought of this during the past weeks. During the summer I work as web developer and designer at
an consultancy firm, and am responsible for some things. That means there's lot of communication.
E-mail, todos, documenting, and more. The thing is with digital communication is that it's always
there, slipping through my mental blocks which are set up to protect my &quot;creative working mode&quot;.
Of course notifications may be turned off, but that's not fixing the core problem.</p>

                    <div class="prose excerpt f5"><p><a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a> is a revolutionary service which has done most things right. A great
native, desktop application and a companion iPhone/Android/other smartphones app makes it the most
tasteful music streaming service from my point of view. It's been quite controversial offering users
free and unlimited streaming of almost all music in the world, if you were willing to put up with a
few ads. Up until now. One of the co-founders, Daniel Ek, posted on the Spotify blog that the Free
and Open options will see some changes effective May 1st. These changes doesn't affect new users
– the ones who has set up their accounts on or after November 1st – for another six months. Free or
Open accounts created before November 1st will be able to play each track in the catalogue <strong>for
free up to 5 times</strong>, and the total listening time per month will be <strong>10 hours</strong>. Sounds shocking
in the sense that Spotify has always been completely free with the Free options since it launched,
but I completely understand and encourage Spotify's decision. They need income, as every other
company. Sure, you get lots of goodwill and good karma from regular people who just wants to listen
to music for free, but where's the profit in that? Ads can't pay everything. They're still keeping
the Free option, of course, but a little bit stripped down to lead people into the Unlimited or
Premium options. Seriously: 50-100 SEK per month isn't a big deal for unlimited music. Today's news
certainly pushed me to upgrade.</p></div>

raging campaign of the iPad vs. the rest of the (newly assembled) tablet manufacturer crowd, it's
clear that the former is a hit. But what about magazines? There's been quite a boom on the digital
magazine front – large and small publishers have pushed issues out on the App Store, or via
publishing platforms like Qiozk, Paperton and Mag+. But there hasn't been any &quot;Wow&quot;-effect. Many of
the magazines consists of static images (!) made &quot;interactive&quot; with flashy animations and layer
effects.</p></div>

<p>Yesterday Apple updated us with some info about the next version of the Mac operating system,
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/">OS X Lion</a>. Lots of UI polishes, with a new default wallpaper
amongst others (as usual with every major OS update). It's a photo of Fuji in shades of pink and
purple and it looks pretty slick.</p></div>

it's absolutely not dead – the technology is everywhere on the web! It's built in inside every major
blog system, CMS, web framework and web app. That's not a dead technology. The problem is, as the
article puts it, that RSS hasn't received the widespread user base it deserves. It's being ignored,
and failed by browser vendors and others.</p></div>

Twitter clients come and go, but this one had me at &quot;Helvetica&quot;. Trickle is a client which doesn't
have all features you're used to. Tweets from your timeline is &quot;trickling&quot; in white Helvetica on the
dark screen from the right while the device quietly sits on your desk (preferably in a dock). It
does three things: shows tweets, retweets and favorites. Very simple. No profiles, links, replies,
DMs, etc. Just plain and raw tweets. I think it's quite perfect. To have your Twitter stream on the
side makes it subtle and non-disturbing. I don't like tabbing to a designated Twitter
client/Twitter.com to check stuff. Now I can just throw a glance at the iPhone. It's universal and
therefore works with the iPad, and I can only imagine how nice Trickle would look on a larger iPad
display on your desk.</p></div>
