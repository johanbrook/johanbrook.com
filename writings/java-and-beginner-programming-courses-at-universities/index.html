This fall I went to university for a major in software engineering. Of course we were going to learn to program, but in the beginning it was a huge turnoff for me — we were doing it in Java. Why?<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I’m by no means an experienced software engineer or programmer. I focus on front-end web development, and this is only my opinions on learning to program from a student’s perspective.<p>How do you really learn to program? Not just in a specific language, but the general idea — the logic, the ability to think in abstractions, algorithms, to see the flows of a program? There are freshmen at software engineering and computer science university programs who have never programmed before, and it’s not a simple and quick task to teach these students the idioms and thoughts behind programming. What’s the most <strong>efficient, student friendly, and most pedagogical way of teaching how to think in code?</strong><p>As mentioned, I went to university this fall. I considered myself lucky, since I had programmed before. I.e., I had taken a couple of courses in high school and after that worked with web technologies as a freelancer. I had been exposed to both the academical and practical side of programming.<p>The three courses I took in high school taught us Java. We were first supposed to study C++ during the first two courses, and take Java last, but the school decided to go for Java for all three, in a way to let us get a firm grasp of programming and general OO principles. Java was hence the first real programming language I actively used. During the senior year I began studying other languages lightly. PHP seemed like heaven with dynamic typing in all its glory, and Javascript was a nice buddy I could see myself hang out with. Later Ruby and Python lured (but I haven’t to this day begun learning them seriously).<p>I had heard from other students that Java was the language tutored at this university program I was to apply for. My heart sank a bit since I had begun to grasp code minimalism, “beautiful code”, and DRY. According to me, Java isn’t really embracing those teachings.<p>I had a couple of theories about why, oh why, the university chose Java to teach new students:<ul><li><strong>It’s cross-platform.</strong> Students run OS X, Linux, or Windows, and you can get Java up and running effortlessly on these platforms.<li><strong>It’s object oriented.</strong> The two programming courses we had during the past fall were actually titles Object Oriented Development (beginner and intermediate). Java was built with many solid object oriented ideologies in regard: inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, dynamic binding, etc. If you have a solid understanding of the OO in Java, there’s a good change you’ll grasp any other OO language in very short time.<li>It’s widely used in the <strong>enterprise</strong> sector (or my <em>“Who’s waiting for the fresh students after they graduate?”</em> theory).<li><strong>It’s quite versatile.</strong> The university can use Java to teach full blown desktop applications, database programming, GUI design, web server programming, and in recent years mobile app development (Android).</ul><h2>But what about the cons of teaching Java to new students?</h2><ul><li>Its bloated syntax might be an obstacle when learning how to program. Why should a beginner care about curly braces? Why should he or she even have to ponder over what <code>static</code> is? As soon as the teacher states: Don’t worry about , we’ll get to that in course X and leaves the students dumb-founded, there’s something rotten going on.<li>The lack of simplicity, and need for boilerplate code. Tasks you pull off in Ruby in a line of code can take up several lines in Java. The question is: should the students be forced to write a lot of code by themselves, or should the language serve convenience methods for even the simplest tasks? Or both?<li>Overly complicated and sometimes utterly useless design patterns. <code>AbstractModelFactory</code> , I’m looking at you.</ul><p>I think it all boils down to: <em>Is the possible pain and frustration associated with Java worth getting a solid foundation in object orientation, scanning through documentation, diving deep into Swing, and worrying about semicolons?</em> Perhaps.<p>What’s the focus? Learn to program in general, or learn a single language? Sometimes I think my university focus a bit too much on Java. They should branch out and bring in examples from other languages once in a while. In the end, I think universities often use Java since it’s the shotgun solution: You can squeeze in quite a large curriculum with Java, it’s widely used in the industry, it teaches basic OO concepts.<p>If it was up to me, I’d teach Ruby to new students. Just to get a hang of basic program flows, printing and reading data to a console (I/O), calculations, string manipulations, and then move on to methods, classes, objects, et al. It would only serve as a intro tool to programming. Sure, you can’t create an Android app with Ruby, but I think it would be godsent for the totally new students. The downside? These students would have to learn Java later on instead.<p>One could debate wether it’s good or bad for new students to learn two programming languages in a short period of time. But when I see students struggling with why they can’t call methods on an <code>int</code> in Java — like they can on a <code>String</code> — and other things, I wonder if Java is the right choice to start out with.</div></article></main><footer class=mb3 role=contentinfo><nav><ul class=mb3><li><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=mailto:webmaster@johan.im rel=me>Email</a><li><a href=https://hachyderm.io/@brookie rel=me>Mastodon</a><li><a href=/feed.xml title=Atom>Post feed</a><li><a href=/mind.xml title=Atom>Mind feed</a><li><a href=/reading.xml title=Atom>Reading feed</a></ul></nav></footer></div><nav class=MainNav role=navigation><h1 class=f4><a aria-label=Home href=/> <span>Johan Brook</span><span class="BackLink ml2"aria-hidden=true>←</span> </a></h1><ul class=NavCommon><li aria-current=page><a href=/writings/>Writings</a><li><a href=/mind/>On my mind</a><li><a href=/now/>Now</a><li><a href=/reading/>Reading</a><li><a href=/to-read/>To read</a><li><a href=/about/>About me</a><li><a href=/quotes/>Quotes</a><li><a href=/changelog/>Changelog</a><li><a href=/credits/>Credits</a></ul></nav></div><script>if(window.location.host!==new URL('https://johan.im').host){window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}};if(window.location.hash==='#skipgc')localStorage.setItem('skipgc','t');if(localStorage.getItem('skipgc')==='t')window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}</script><script async data-goatcounter=https://johanbrook.goatcounter.com/count src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script>
