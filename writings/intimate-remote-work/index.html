      <p><strong>In <a href="http://lookback.io">Lookback</a>,</strong> we’ve had the notion of being able to <em>work remote</em> as a
baseline since day one. Here are some of my thoughts on the deeper end of working remote, on
personal levels.</p>
<p>This is from our <a href="http://lookback.io/jobs">jobs page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve chosen to build a distributed team. We don’t want anyone to move because of us. On the
contrary, we want to empower people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where in the world are you the most productive and creative? That’s where you should work from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Working remote is a thing many (often smaller to medium sized) software companies pick up these days
– Basecamp (formerly 37signals) are huge fans, so huge they
<a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">wrote a book on it</a>. Companies sort of realise that all talent
necessarily don’t want to live in San Francisco, New York, Stockholm, or some other tech hub. At
Lookback, we often call it <em>distributed work</em>, since it implies that there should be no centralized
office where everything is orchestrated from (even though half of the team resides in San Francisco
at the moment).</p>
<p>Some friends of mine often ask how we maintain personal relationships and keep a great workflow in
order to churn out high quality work together. I think these two things are tremendously important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put in the energy, tolerance, and love, as in any relationship</li>
<li>Realise it’s a neverending process</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image--full image--hover">

</figure>
<p>From my own experience, relationships demands <em>a lot</em> of energy. Not in a bad way, just a lot of
dedication, will, and determination. Even non-romantical ones, such as friendships, needs some love
once in a while in order to maintain that friendly bond you have with a person.</p>
<p>The same is with job relationships when working remote. If a successful company is to be built,
where the employees create great products, they need to be closer to each other than just a chat
avatar in Slack. Your mileage may vary of course; some people don’t have this need. I’ve realised
these things have worked well for us in Lookback:</p>
<h2>Have physical meetups</h2>
<p>Obvious but easily forgotten. So much fun, and can be really productive! Eat food, hang out, talk
about high level things as company culture, long term goals, “soft subjects”. Last meetup, we had a
typical team building activity involving cooking food together at a restaurant (we actually got to
make our own sausages <em>completely</em> how we wanted them). Then we discussed really deep personal
subjects, such as priorities, workflows, and assumptions. This was so fruitful, and brought us
closer on a new level.</p>
<h2>Have an Emotions chat room</h2>
<p>One day, our CEO Jonatan created an <em>Emotions</em> chat channel in Slack. It was for “venting stuff”,
which we had seen a pattern of people doing in various other channels. So this channel’s purpose
would solely be for expressing things like you would often have at a physical office, perhaps 1-on-1
with a co-worker. Again, some people are in more need of this than others, but even if you’re not
writing in there yourself, just being able to tune in others’ mood is really helpful in day to day
work. For instance, if a co-worker has a hard time at home with the kids, he or she might be really
drained on energy. That wouldn’t be exposed anywhere else in a team wide way if it’s not clearly
communicated in an <em>Emotions</em> channel.</p>
<p>Having this room has given us the notion of that <em>it’s okay to feel and express yourself to your
co-workers</em> even if you’re remote. It’s a safe zone for good and bad moods. People around me can
automatically adjust to me if I ventilate that I’ve had a really bad week due to X, and have that in
the back of their heads when they’re discussing product features and planning on Trello or whatever.</p>
<h2>Constantly tweak it</h2>
<p>Remote workflows are complex. Async communication is great for some and hard for others. It demands
understanding, tolerance, and over-communication.</p>
<p>We need to <em>understand</em> each other’s way of working, and one another’s <em>needs</em>. One person might
need more coaching and 1-on-1s, while another person communicates like a natural born remote worker
on Trello/Slack/forums.</p>
<p>This needs to a constant circle of always-be-tweaking mindset, where we never settly. Everybody
should be able to voice their opinions about the remote workflow in order to make it better, even by
saying <em>this thing X isn’t working out for me</em>.</p>
<p>Example: we used Flowdock for chatting in the beginning. It’s a great chat platform: it has got
everything Slack has with slightly different UX. Our main thing was the use of <em>threads</em>. Instead of
having everything in the same bucket (a channel) people could start new threads to discuss a single
topic within a channel (this might come to Slack soon, a bird tweeted in my ear). Anyhow, this was
getting more complex to maintain as the company grew to twelve people, and we moved over to Slack
just to ease the communication for everybody in the team. We moved over to Discourse from GitHub
Issues for our internal forum, since GitHub worked well <em>in theory</em> but wasn’t meant to be a forum
in the first place.</p>
<h2>Over-communicate</h2>
<p>So easy to reason about but hard to pull off! It’s an art, practiced in many contexts: on Trello, in
Slack, in the forum. A rule of thumb I’ve got is to really voice <em>all</em> relevant information I have
in a certain situation. That is, bring up stuff like future blockers, opportunities, future steps,
and so on. If you work in different timezones, as we do, this is even more important, since a day’s
work might be slightly blocked or boosted just by your ability to share information before you go to
bed and your co-workers continues the joint work.</p>
<p>Repetitions are fine, since they prevent future misassumptions. Have a single source of truth,
whether it’s a document, Trello card, or forum thread. And to me, <strong>few things beat face-to-face,
synchronous voice chats</strong>. Talking with each other in voice brings out another layer of subtle
communication patterns, rather than speaking with each other in a text chat.</p>
<h2>Have personal retrospectives</h2>
<p>We’ve got weekly retrospectives, where we rate these topics on a scale 1-10:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Happiness.</strong> Our general happiness level during the week. Are we happy with life? Why/why not?</li>
<li><strong>Restedness.</strong> Are we drained or tired? Why?</li>
<li><strong>Productivity.</strong> Did we feel we achieved a lot during the week?</li>
<li><strong>Team spirit.</strong> Did we have fruitful 1-on-1s, or some other breakthrough feeling of being close
to the team? Or just a general notion of <em>hell yeah we’re the best</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>We keep this in a Google Docs spreadsheet, and it’s completely open to read each other’s ratings and
comments for anybody in the team. This is another, recurring layer on top of the more impulsive
<em>Emotions</em> chat channel discussed above.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think much boils down to the notion of that individuals that are close to each other can build
better products (beware, totally un-scientific theory). Yes, remote work demands energy. Yes, remote
work needs constant love, tinkering, and individual adjustments. It might not be for everybody. But
when you achieve this cool equilibrium remote work in different time zones can bring, it’s pure
bliss.</p>
