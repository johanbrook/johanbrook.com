So much knowledge, inspiration, and experience is passed on from one and another — may it be with blogs, tweets, forum posts, or post comments. I think it’s an incredible phenomenon and what’s driving the web forward: developing an idea, share it, discuss it, get feedback. I will in this post discuss some of the articles I find really interesting, smart, or just plain good read.<h2>Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte</h2><p><a href=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/>http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/</a><p>What to say about this ground breaking article by Mr. Marcotte? Well, it will surely go down in the annals to our grandchildren as the one article that spawned a shift in paradigms. I remember when I first read it: I found the result very cool, but it took some effort for me to wrap my head around the techniques (the source code). Nevertheless, responsive web design is now a global “movement” (or whatever) which is becoming a standard way of building web sites among respected designers and developers. Thanks Ethan!<h2>The secret law of page harmony by Alex Charchar</h2><p><a href=http://retinart.net/graphic-design/secret-law-of-page-harmony/>http://retinart.net/graphic-design/secret-law-of-page-harmony/</a><p>I could have just linked to Retinart.net, which is where Alex Charchar writes deep and thoughtful articles about graphic design, typography, and layout. They are inspiring and do what a good article should do: grow a seed of thought in its reader. The secret law of page harmony is especially a good read, since it made me think about layout, modules, and ratios in a new way.<h2>Rethinking CSS grids by Mark Boulton</h2><p><a href=http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/rethinking-css-grids>http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/rethinking-css-grids</a><p>Mark Boulton (the King of Grids) is writing about how he should model a new grid module in CSS, i.e. how the syntax of defining columns, gutters and everything should work. Mr. Boulton is also writing a <a href=http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/>book</a> on grid systems for the web, as well as releasing a tool – <a title="Gridset – create advanced grid systems on the web"href=http://johanbrook.com/design/css/gridset/>Gridset</a> – for working with grids online.<h2>The design of HTML5 by Jeremy Keith</h2><p><a href=http://adactio.com/articles/1704/>http://adactio.com/articles/1704/</a><p>A transcription of one of Jeremy Keith’s great talks. Recommended.<h2>To hell with bad devices: Responsive web design and web standards by Marc Drummond</h2><p><a href=http://marcdrummond.com/web-standards/2011/06/20/hell-bad-devices-responsive-web-design-and-web-standards>http://marcdrummond.com/web-standards/2011/06/20/hell-bad-devices-responsive-web-design-and-web-standards</a><p>Essential reading about responsive web design, mobile, and all.<h2>Native vs. web apps by Faruk Ateş</h2><p><a href=http://farukat.es/journal/2011/03/537-native-vs-web-apps>http://farukat.es/journal/2011/03/537-native-vs-web-apps</a><p>Ambitious post which sums up the “Native vs. web apps” discussion quite well. I have come to the opinion that web apps should not try to mimic native apps in everything. Creating a native looking iOS for instance, will force you to squeeze water from a rock in order to duplicate every UI detail in the OS’s look and feel, which took Apple themselves a good period of time (and they wrote it in native code!). I’m talking about view transitions, touch responsiveness, and general UX. You just <em>know</em> when you are using a web app which is trying so hard to be native. Please don’t. Use the web’s strengths, and make web apps that are built for the web.<h2>The graphing calculator story by Ron Avitzur</h2><p><a href=http://www.pacifict.com/Story/>http://www.pacifict.com/Story/</a><p>A post about an undercover project inside Apple (!), which is very interesting.<h2>Tom Williams: Hired by Apple at 14 by Derek Sivers</h2><p><a href=http://sivers.org/tom-williams>http://sivers.org/tom-williams</a><p>A story about strong will, entrepreneurship, and that anything really is possible.<hr><p>Perhaps I have forgotten some of the gems I have read, but in that case I will update this post. It’s tricky to go back in time and try to remember all the good stuff you have read. I really should try start using a link collecting service …</div></article></main><footer class=mb3 role=contentinfo><nav><ul class=mb3><li><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=mailto:webmaster@johan.im rel=me>Email</a><li><a href=https://hachyderm.io/@brookie rel=me>Mastodon</a><li><a href=/feed.xml title=Atom>Post feed</a><li><a href=/mind.xml title=Atom>Mind feed</a><li><a href=/reading.xml title=Atom>Reading feed</a></ul></nav></footer></div><nav class=MainNav role=navigation><div class=sticky><h1 class="f3 sr-only-mobile"><a aria-label=Home href=/> <span>Johan Brook</span><span class="BackLink ml2"aria-hidden=true>←</span> </a></h1><ul class=NavCommon><li class=only-mobile><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=/writings/>Writings</a><li><a href=/mind/>On my mind</a><li><a href=/now/>Now</a><li><a href=/reading/>Reading</a><li><a href=/to-read/>To read</a><li><a href=/about/>About me</a><li><a href=/quotes/>Quotes</a><li><a href=/changelog/>Changelog</a><li><a href=/credits/>Credits</a></ul></div></nav></div><script>if(window.location.host!==new URL('https://johan.im').host){window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}};if(window.location.hash==='#skipgc')localStorage.setItem('skipgc','t');if(localStorage.getItem('skipgc')==='t')window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}</script><script async data-goatcounter=https://johanbrook.goatcounter.com/count src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script>
