It's regulated by several licenses, but no true committee of some sort. Sure it's anarchy, but a wonderful anarchy. To me Open Source is in its essence a unique creation by us humans, and reflects what I think is vital to many things (unrelated to software) – sharing. Sharing stuff is awesome. Sharing discoveries, code, insights, assets, techniques – knowledge in all kinds of ways. I wouldn't be able to do what I love without that phenomenon.<p>Linked to Open Source there's sites like <strong>GitHub</strong> which brings web creators together. Never before has it been easier to start hacking on a project (even large-scale ones). I've gained so much knowledge from browsing around other people's code on GitHub. Pulling down projects, fixing issues, discussing decisions, adding features – it's all so easy with today's tools and communities. It's intoxicating.<p>During the past couple of years the idea of <strong>open data</strong> and <strong>APIs</strong> has been growing stronger. It's wicked cool watching all kinds of services and apps being created on top of free for all data.<p>When I finally started to get my eyes off PHP and checked out other languages for web development, I was blown off by the huge pain of deploying the resulting hacks. Sure – Ruby and Python was beautiful, cool and hipster, but how could I put them online? I had no idea (even to this day, I have very vague knowledge about deploying Ruby code on a custom server). Then came <strong>Heroku</strong> and other app platform services. And they are awesome. The time it takes to setup and deploy a simple Rails app on Heroku is almost shorter than what it takes to make my morning coffee. And the basic plan for quick hacks is free! Crazy cool.<hr><p>All the paragraphs above describes what I absolutely love about the internet and our technologies.<p><strong>Anyone is able to create anything from anywhere</strong><p>With some willpower, a computer, ideas, and an eagerness to learn, anyone can create and publish on the internet.<p><strong>And it's all built and driven by humans with a passion for creating things</strong><p>Sometimes I love the internet so much it hurts.</div></article></main><footer class=mb3 role=contentinfo><nav><ul class=mb3><li><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=mailto:webmaster@johan.im rel=me>Email</a><li><a href=https://hachyderm.io/@brookie rel=me>Mastodon</a><li><a href=/feed.xml title=Atom>Post feed</a><li><a href=/mind.xml title=Atom>Mind feed</a><li><a href=/reading.xml title=Atom>Reading feed</a><li><a href=/credits>Credits</a><li><a href=/changelog>Changelog</a></ul></nav><p class="muted mb0">Using <a class=font-mono href=https://github.com/johanbrook/johanbrook.com/commit/08d7a0fd3fdd0084bc6f1d43fdd564aa8d9a4ee1>08d7a0f</a> — built at <time>2023-03-06T22:25:54.232Z</time> — web 1.0 and 2.0 compatible.</footer></div></div><script>if(window.location.host!==new URL('https://johan.im').host){window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}};if(window.location.hash==='#skipgc')localStorage.setItem('skipgc','t');if(localStorage.getItem('skipgc')==='t')window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}</script><script async data-goatcounter=https://johanbrook.goatcounter.com/count src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script>
