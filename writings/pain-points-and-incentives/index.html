You can't make them good unless you believe in them and really <em>understand the problem you're trying to solve</em>. This is of course Johan-stating-the-obvious, but I experienced this the other day.<p>Our CEO at <a href=http://lookback.io>Lookback</a>, <a href=http://twitter.com/littke>Jonatan</a>, once said that he had heard from Slack that their success largely depended on that everyone in their team really understood the product. By understanding the product, I refer to the problems it tries to solve. By "problems", I mean real pain points.<p>It's easy to mindlessly build features by taking cards out of the backlog – rinse and repeat. But they'll only be <em>so</em> good – in order for features to achieve their fullest potential, its creators must be given the freedom to explore different routes, but also they need <em>empathy</em>.<p>Two stories:<h2>Feeling the users</h2><p>Me and Jonatan visited some Silicon Valley companies the other day, where we did some lightweight user testing and interviews centering around <a href=https://lookback.io/watch/rWcyfETYu8vsrYpAY>Lookback's new player</a>. The player is the creation of our awesome designer <a href=http://twitter.com/tobiasahlin>Tobias</a> and myself. Tobias had taken part of customer meetings beforehand, so he had witnessed their pain points up front with his eyes. I was sitting around on the west coast of Sweden, always taking on the newest design mocks from Tobias. When <em>I</em> visited the before mentioned customers in the valley, it was the first time I'd seen a customer interacting with our product – with the player I built. It was an enlightening experience, since I felt: <em>"Wow, we really need to fix [this]"</em> or <em>"Shit, we should totally go in [this] direction!"</em>.<p>It reminded me of what's important with our product, and that's a thing a remote chat never can express. I felt empathy when we met our contacts at the company, when they described their workflow and mentioned things like <em>"Yeah, it would be cool to do [this] in the player"</em> or described a bug. I instantly wanted to make it up do them somehow, since I was emotionally invested in their workflow now.<h2>Making it <em>your</em> feature</h2><p>When you're solving a thing for yourself – your own sake – it'll probably be a good creation. You know what you want, and create it: a one-to-one relationship between incentive and outcome.<p>A user experience researcher from Quora – who's an avid Lookback user – requested a way to transcribe comments from a Lookback recording. That is, somehow export comments made while watching a user test. When I heard about it, I thought <em>"Yeah, that'd be cool, but ..."</em> and then I put it on a mental to do somewhere and forgot about it. When I last week experienced that very need for the feature, it was another scenario: I immediately started to think of the implementation, interface, and usage of exporting comments to Markdown or similar. I immediately created a card in Trello. See the difference? I had made it <em>my</em> feature since it filled <em>my</em> need.<hr><p>This is of course common knowledge, but I nevertheless think it's something that's easy to forget. Building products for people involves actually interacting and understanding them and their needs, before you decide what to build.</div></article></main></div><footer class=mb3 role=contentinfo><nav><ul class="f5 list-reset mb3"><li><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=/feed.xml title=Atom>Post feed</a><li><a href=/mind.xml title=Atom>Mind feed</a><li><a href=/credits>Credits</a><li><a href=/changelog>Changelog</a><li><a href=/api.json>api.json</a><li><a href=mailto:webmaster@johan.im rel=me title=Email>webmaster@johan.im</a><li><a href=https://hachyderm.io/@brookie rel=me title=Mastodon>@brookie@johan.im</a></ul></nav><p class="muted f6 tc mb0">Using <a class=font-mono href=https://github.com/johanbrook/johanbrook.com/commit/d9e856b4955207fd85f3194057b7b484fce5e8b8>d9e856b</a> — built at <time>2023-02-13T20:56:04.850Z</time> — web 1.0 and 2.0 compatible.</footer><script>if(window.location.host!==new URL('https://johan.im').host){window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}};if(window.location.hash==='#skipgc')localStorage.setItem('skipgc','t');if(localStorage.getItem('skipgc')==='t')window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}</script><script async data-goatcounter=https://johanbrook.goatcounter.com/count src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script>
