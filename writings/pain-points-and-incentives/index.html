      <p><strong>When working with building features in a product</strong>, I usually need some emotional attachment to
them. You can't make them good unless you believe in them and really <em>understand the problem you're
trying to solve</em>. This is of course Johan-stating-the-obvious, but I experienced this the other day.</p>
<p>Our CEO at <a href="http://lookback.io">Lookback</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/littke">Jonatan</a>, once said that he
had heard from Slack that their success largely depended on that everyone in their team really
understood the product. By understanding the product, I refer to the problems it tries to solve. By
"problems", I mean real pain points.</p>
<p>It's easy to mindlessly build features by taking cards out of the backlog – rinse and repeat. But
they'll only be <em>so</em> good – in order for features to achieve their fullest potential, its creators
must be given the freedom to explore different routes, but also they need <em>empathy</em>.</p>
<p>Two stories:</p>
<h2>Feeling the users</h2>
<p>Me and Jonatan visited some Silicon Valley companies the other day, where we did some lightweight
user testing and interviews centering around
<a href="https://lookback.io/watch/rWcyfETYu8vsrYpAY">Lookback's new player</a>. The player is the creation of
our awesome designer <a href="http://twitter.com/tobiasahlin">Tobias</a> and myself. Tobias had taken part of
customer meetings beforehand, so he had witnessed their pain points up front with his eyes. I was
sitting around on the west coast of Sweden, always taking on the newest design mocks from Tobias.
When <em>I</em> visited the before mentioned customers in the valley, it was the first time I'd seen a
customer interacting with our product – with the player I built. It was an enlightening experience,
since I felt: <em>"Wow, we really need to fix [this]"</em> or <em>"Shit, we should totally go in [this]
direction!"</em>.</p>
<p>It reminded me of what's important with our product, and that's a thing a remote chat never can
express. I felt empathy when we met our contacts at the company, when they described their workflow
and mentioned things like <em>"Yeah, it would be cool to do [this] in the player"</em> or described a bug.
I instantly wanted to make it up do them somehow, since I was emotionally invested in their workflow
now.</p>
<h2>Making it <em>your</em> feature</h2>
<p>When you're solving a thing for yourself – your own sake – it'll probably be a good creation. You
know what you want, and create it: a one-to-one relationship between incentive and outcome.</p>
<p>A user experience researcher from Quora – who's an avid Lookback user –&nbsp;requested a way to
transcribe comments from a Lookback recording. That is, somehow export comments made while watching
a user test. When I heard about it, I thought <em>"Yeah, that'd be cool, but ..."</em> and then I put it on
a mental to do somewhere and forgot about it. When I last week experienced that very need for the
feature, it was another scenario: I immediately started to think of the implementation, interface,
and usage of exporting comments to Markdown or similar. I immediately created a card in Trello. See
the difference? I had made it <em>my</em> feature since it filled <em>my</em> need.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is of course common knowledge, but I nevertheless think it's something that's easy to forget.
Building products for people involves actually interacting and understanding them and their needs,
before you decide what to build.</p>
