It's a lot cleaner and to me more readable than the previous one. Some points to bring up:<h2>Layout</h2><p>I still go with the two-column layout. This time, I fully ditched any 12 or 16 column grids, and went fluid all the way, i.e. I've made all measures relative to each other, and the Golden Ratio. I've used a 6pt baseline grid, and a <a href=http://modularscale.com/>modular scale</a>. It was actually quite relaxing 'letting go' of the old grids and start fresh.<p><a href=http://f.cl.ly/items/1Y0L3g0l1K2y3u2A2t3Q/Slammer.png><img alt=Grid src=http://f.cl.ly/items/1Y0L3g0l1K2y3u2A2t3Q/Slammer.png></a> Frontpage with Golden Ratio, module, and baseline overlay<p>Try adding <code>?dev=1</code> to any URL on the site, and press and hold G on your keyboard to view the baseline grid.<h2>Typography and Colours</h2><p>Switched the somewhat boring Georgia for <strong>PT Serif</strong>, and Helvetica for <strong>Lato</strong>. Both are served via Google Webfonts Directory. The goal with the realignment was to create more whitespace to focus on the typography, and for that great typefaces were needed.<p>This is also the first time I use the new-ish <code>rem</code> unit (with a fallback). There are almost no pixel values as far as the eyes can see.<p>The colour palette is quite sparse: just plain white, kinda-black, and cerise red.<h2>Under the Hood</h2><p>I have for once not used Compass for this project. Don't know why, just felt for a change – trying out something new. That 'new' is <a href=http://thoughtbot.com/bourbon/>Bourbon</a> by Thoughtbot. A lightweight collection of Sass mixins. Might as well, right?<p>The very small amount of Javascript I've included is written in CoffeeScript, which I've been dabbling with recently.<h2>Responsiveness</h2><p>No need to explain anything here. I believe every web designer and developer with self-respect should create responsive websites for themselves and clients these days. For this one I have two breakpoints set in ems. There is no max-width of the container.<h2>Javascript?</h2><p>Nope, almost none. I don't need jQuery for anything, so it felt good getting rid of all that fat.<h2>More writing?</h2><p>Hopefully this will encourage me to blog more often :) (as I and many before me have said – all the time).<p>Thanks for reading.</div></article></main></div><footer class=mb3 role=contentinfo><nav><ul class="f6 list-reset mb3"><li><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=/feed.xml title=Atom>Post feed</a><li><a href=/mind.xml title=Atom>Mind feed</a><li><a href=/credits>Credits</a><li><a href=/changelog>Changelog</a><li><a href=/api.json>api.json</a></ul></nav><p class="muted f6 tc mb0">Using <a class=font-mono href=https://github.com/johanbrook/johanbrook.com/commit/c830d3d2c9c958207f68a738d31474b24a77bae9>c830d3d</a> — built at <time>2023-01-26T08:14:58.352Z</time> — web 1.0 and 2.0 compatible.</footer><script>if(window.location.host!==new URL('https://johan.im').host){window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}};if(window.location.hash==='#skipgc')localStorage.setItem('skipgc','t');if(localStorage.getItem('skipgc')==='t')window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}</script><script async data-goatcounter=https://johanbrook.goatcounter.com/count src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script>
