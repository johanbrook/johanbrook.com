      <p>The year started off with three weeks in Sri Lanka, where I naturally didn’t bring my laptop. I also only had phone internet while on wi-ﬁ (didn’t buy a data plan), which was lovely. This, combined with early evenings, led me to read much more than during whole 2019.</p>
<p>Here are the ones I worked through:</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel)"><span class="pull-double">“</span>The Alchemist”</a>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Paolo Coelho</h2>
<p>★★★☆☆</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> It’s nice to have read it, but once is enough.</p>
<p>The modern classic. The one<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>everybody” have read. The book is very short and succinct. Coelho uses the story arc of a fable about a young herd boy, who sets out to ﬁnd a treasure and follow his dreams, while being challenged with delays, hinders, and personal developments.</p>
<p>I liked it a lot as a travel book. It suited me well while I stepped away from my everyday life in Stockholm. However, once I realised the meaning and aim with the book (which is pretty obvious), it became less interesting. It has a lot of<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>lessons” which the protagonist learns along the way, but after a while, it just felt <em>very</em> repetitive and ﬂat. Everything is an allegory. Everything is a symbol for something else. I didn’t see how some global Force, which is mentioned throughout the book, could help me in everyday life.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zahir_(novel)"><span class="pull-double">“</span>The Zahir”</a> — Paolo Coelho</h2>
<p>★★☆☆☆</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Alright in the beginning, but becomes repetitive and ﬂat.</p>
<p>Another one by mr. Coelho. This one, I found in a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Free Books” box a long time ago, and decided to bring on the Sri Lanka trip. After <em>The Alchemist</em> above, it felt nice to continue with the same author in the same writing style. Again, this is an okay book to have while travelling. It’s about how a man deals with the sudden disappearance of his wife; about ﬁnding clues and explanations of her behaviour. Then it becomes, like <em>The Alchemist</em>, a pilgrimage.</p>
<p><em>The Zahir</em> in the beginning started out alright. Then it escalated in the same New Age style Coelho had in his other books, about<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>the power of love” which I thought never had any substance and backing by the author. On top of that, it became obvious that the books is <em>very</em> autobiographical. The main protagonist’s story strongly resembles the career of the author, which makes the whole book seem egoistical and self centered. The text isn’t that shy with sharing details about the ﬁnances, luxury life, and sexual conquests of the protagonist/Coelho. It just shines through very much, which makes the book less likable.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snow_Leopard"><span class="pull-double">“</span>The Snow Leopard”</a>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Peter Matthiessen</h2>
<p>★★★★☆</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Long sentences aside, I thought <em>The Snow Leopard</em> is a beautiful book about nature&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;both human and the one surrounding us.</p>
<p>The subjects this book has in common with the two previous ones are <em>spirituality</em> and <em>pilgrimage</em> (a funny coincidence, actually). Whereas Coelho’s writing is based in an<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>idea world”, Matthiessen’s style is more tangible&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;more based in our physical world.</p>
<p><em>The Snow Leopard</em> is a non-ﬁction account of a 1973 expedition the author and naturalist George Schaller made to Nepal, with the objective of studying the Himalayan<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>blue sheep” in their natural habitat. For Matthiessen, the journey was a spiritual one, driven by the deep interest Buddhism and Zen, in the aftermaths of his wife’s death in cancer some year before. As the title prescribes, a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>side quest” of the expidition is to get a glimpse of the mythical Snow Leopard, which becomes a symbol of the inner journey of the author.</p>
<p>We get to follow the hardships of the two month long trip through the Himalayan mountains in western Nepal. The language is old fashioned but elegant, and the author describes the mountains with great skill (I say, without having been there!). The two Americans travel with porters, carrying the equipment, and Sherpas: the local people of the mountains, often hired as guides. The myriad of villages they pass through is described in detail by Matthiessen, as well as the surrounding landscapes. Once in a while, he goes off in a ﬂashback to the last months of his wife’s suffering. More often, he describes Buddhist history of the country, and his Zen practices of meditation and quest for tranquility.</p>
<p>For me, many topics in the book landed on the subject of <em>acceptance</em>. Total acceptance of the state of things and all beings. Total acceptance of the various mishaps during their trip, as well as keeping zero expectations around seeing the shy Snow Leopard. I feel this<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>expectation management” can be applied to modern life by anybody.</p>
<p>Peter Matthiessen is not afraid to describe himself in bad manner: the frustration, the pettiness, the eagerness, the anxiety over his wife’s death. He’s open about all these things. I appreciate honesty and writing about things that are true. It’s not hard to note the Zen undertones everywhere (Matthiessen went off becoming a Zen priest himself), which creates a larger-than-life feel to the text. After ﬁnishing the book, it really felt like having been on an adventure.</p>
<p>It could be a slow read though. It’s not a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>page turner”, but doesn’t try to be either. There are long sentences and descriptions which might scare people off. Don’t be in a hurry. Hopefully, it’ll open one’s eyes more to Zen literature (it did for me).</p>
