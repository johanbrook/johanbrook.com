In that one, I wrote about a spaghetti bolognese recipe which I thought I'd, pretentious as I am, perfected over the years.<p>We recently spent a month in Florence, Italy, where we stayed with a host family. For one birthday party for their grandchild, the family father had made a ragú sauce served with penne pasta. The sauce was amazing: rich, juicy, and smooth. I asked for the recipe, and will present it in this post.<h2>The ingredients</h2><ul><li>1-2 finely chopped garlic cloves.<li>500g of minced pork and beef meat.<li>1-2 celeries.<li>1-2 carrots.<li>1 onion (preferrably red).<li>750g passata (tomato sauce). I ended up adding 1200g of passata since I wanted a saucier feeling.<li>1 glass red wine.<li>Sugar (optional).<li>Meat broth (optional).<li>Plenty of olive oil.<li>Salt and pepper.</ul><p>For the celery, carrot, and onion: the individual units aren't as important as the ratio between them. The recipe I received said: "The same amount of celery and onion, a little less carrot".<p>The amount of olive oil is something one needs to freewheel. I usually go with covering the whole pot with almost one centimeter of oil (depending on the size of pot, of course). There's a lot of fat coming from the pork part in the meat, so beware: <em>that</em> much oil might not be required.<h2>The steps</h2><ol><li>Fry the garlic in a pot or deep pan with plenty of olive oil. Garlic should be added when the oil is hot.<li>Add the meat, and brown it well.<li>When the meat is well cooked, add a finely chopped mixture of celery, carrots, and onion.<li>When the mixture is cooked, add the passata. Add salt to taste, as well as some ground pepper.<li>Wait for the sauce to boil, and add a glass of wine. Wait for it to evaporate completely.<li>Cook over very low heat for at least 30 minutes. If the sauce is too acidic, add a teaspoon of sugar. If it's too dry, add a little meat broth.</ol><p>(I've never needed meat broth in this recipe. There's just no way I've managed to get it too dry.)<p>You can let it sit on the stove without a lid for a couple of hours if you'd like. Or put it on very low heat in the oven (around 100 degrees celsius in my convection oven seemed fine over 5 hours of cooking). I'm not actually sure what the benefits with the oven are – perhaps the sauce becomes different if you heat it from all directions? Who knows.<p>When serving with pasta, don't forget to add around a deciliter of pasta water to the sauce at the end. It "really ties the sauce together", as they say. Parmesan or pecorino is nice to offer too.<p><strong>Done.</strong><h2>Differences from the other recipe</h2><ul><li>50/50 pork and beef instead of 100% beef. The 50/50 mix makes for a more fatty and tasty sauce, thanks to the pork.<li>Cooking the onion, carrots, and celery in the meat instead of sautéing them. This felt kind of weird to me first, since <em>all</em> recipes I read say that you should fry the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery in the pot before adding the meat. I'm not sure about the difference.s<li>Use of more olive oil.<li>Use of meat broth (if needed).</ul><p>This recipe felt simpler but still as good too, which I think should be the goal in cooking. The other recipe has ten steps, this one only has six steps.</div></article></main><footer class=mb3 role=contentinfo><nav><ul class=mb3><li><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=mailto:webmaster@johan.im rel=me>Email</a><li><a href=https://hachyderm.io/@brookie rel=me>Mastodon</a><li><a href=/feed.xml title=Atom>Post feed</a><li><a href=/mind.xml title=Atom>Mind feed</a><li><a href=/reading.xml title=Atom>Reading feed</a><li><a href=/credits>Credits</a><li><a href=/changelog>Changelog</a></ul></nav><p class="muted mb0">Using <a class=font-mono href=https://github.com/johanbrook/johanbrook.com/commit/b735cf89a412f9214f81e9782e0ab08741c30462>b735cf8</a> — built at <time>2023-03-07T22:06:42.098Z</time> — web 1.0 and 2.0 compatible.</footer></div></div><script>if(window.location.host!==new URL('https://johan.im').host){window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}};if(window.location.hash==='#skipgc')localStorage.setItem('skipgc','t');if(localStorage.getItem('skipgc')==='t')window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}</script><script async data-goatcounter=https://johanbrook.goatcounter.com/count src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script>
