      <p>This is a continuation (sequel? remix?) on the post <a href="/writings/my-spaghetti-bolognese">"My Spaghetti Bolognese"</a>. In that one, I wrote about a spaghetti bolognese recipe which I thought I'd, pretentious as I am, perfected over the years.</p>
<p>We recently spent a month in Florence, Italy, where we stayed with a host family. For one birthday party for their grandchild, the family father had made a ragú sauce served with penne pasta. The sauce was amazing: rich, juicy, and smooth. I asked for the recipe, and will present it in this post.</p>
<h2>The ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1-2 finely chopped garlic cloves.</li>
<li>500g of minced pork and beef meat.</li>
<li>1-2 celeries.</li>
<li>1-2 carrots.</li>
<li>1 onion (preferrably red).</li>
<li>750g passata (tomato sauce). I ended up adding 1200g of passata since I wanted a saucier feeling.</li>
<li>1 glass red wine.</li>
<li>Sugar (optional).</li>
<li>Meat broth (optional).</li>
<li>Plenty of olive oil.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the celery, carrot, and onion: the individual units aren't as important as the ratio between them. The recipe I received said: "The same amount of celery and onion, a little less carrot".</p>
<p>The amount of olive oil is something one needs to freewheel. I usually go with covering the whole pot with almost one centimeter of oil (depending on the size of pot, of course). There's a lot of fat coming from the pork part in the meat, so beware: <em>that</em> much oil might not be required.</p>
<h2>The steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fry the garlic in a pot or deep pan with plenty of olive oil. Garlic should be added when the oil is hot.</li>
<li>Add the meat, and brown it well.</li>
<li>When the meat is well cooked, add a finely chopped mixture of celery, carrots, and onion.</li>
<li>When the mixture is cooked, add the passata. Add salt to taste, as well as some ground pepper.</li>
<li>Wait for the sauce to boil, and add a glass of wine. Wait for it to evaporate completely.</li>
<li>Cook over very low heat for at least 30 minutes. If the sauce is too acidic, add a teaspoon of sugar. If it's too dry, add a little meat broth.</li>
</ol>
<p>(I've never needed meat broth in this recipe. There's just no way I've managed to get it too dry.)</p>
<p>You can let it sit on the stove without a lid for a couple of hours if you'd like. Or put it on very low heat in the oven (around 100 degrees celsius in my convection oven seemed fine over 5 hours of cooking). I'm not actually sure what the benefits with the oven are – perhaps the sauce becomes different if you heat it from all directions? Who knows.</p>
<p>When serving with pasta, don't forget to add around a deciliter of pasta water to the sauce at the end. It "really ties the sauce together", as they say. Parmesan or pecorino is nice to offer too.</p>
<p><strong>Done.</strong></p>
<h2>Differences from the other recipe</h2>
<ul>
<li>50/50 pork and beef instead of 100% beef. The 50/50 mix makes for a more fatty and tasty sauce, thanks to the pork.</li>
<li>Cooking the onion, carrots, and celery in the meat instead of sautéing them. This felt kind of weird to me first, since <em>all</em> recipes I read say that you should fry the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery in the pot before adding the meat. I'm not sure about the difference.s</li>
<li>Use of more olive oil.</li>
<li>Use of meat broth (if needed).</li>
</ul>
<p>This recipe felt simpler but still as good too, which I think should be the goal in cooking. The other recipe has ten steps, this one only has six steps.</p>
