It’s the out of control web. The oh my god there’s so much stuff and I can’t possibly keep up web. It’s the spend two dozen times a day checking web. The in one end out the other web. The web designed to appeal to the basest of our intellectual palettes, the salt, sugar and fat of online content web. It’s the scale hard and fast web. The create a destination for billions of people web. The you have two hundred twenty six new updates web. Keep up or be lost. Click me. Like me. Tweet me. Share me. The Fast Web demands that you do things and do them now. The author brings up Instapaper as an example of a Slow Web product: I may be stretching my analogy a bit here, but it’s kind of like boxing up a meal and putting it away in the fridge for when you’re hungry, except in this case, it doesn’t lose as much of its taste. I've actually thought of this during the past weeks. During the summer I work as web developer and designer at an consultancy firm, and am responsible for some things. That means there's lot of communication. E-mail, todos, documenting, and more. The thing is with digital communication is that it's always there, slipping through my mental blocks which are set up to protect my "creative working mode". Of course notifications may be turned off, but that's not fixing the core problem.</blockquote><p>I found the author's thoughts on "Rhythm vs. Random" interesting. That's something you could do yourself: instead of dropping everything you do and answering that e-mail, prepare some time twice a day to check and answer all the e-mails.<p>I understand that you lose the instant communication that e-mail involves – but everything isn't urgent. Some things can wait, like some tweets. Or good food.</div></article></main></div><footer class=mb3 role=contentinfo><nav><ul class="f6 list-reset mb3"><li><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=/feed.xml title=Atom>Post feed</a><li><a href=/mind.xml title=Atom>Mind feed</a><li><a href=/credits>Credits</a><li><a href=/changelog>Changelog</a><li><a href=/api.json>api.json</a><li><a href=mailto:webmaster@johan.im rel=me title=Email>webmaster@johan.im</a><li><a href=https://hachyderm.io/@brookie rel=me title=Mastodon>@brookie@johan.im</a></ul></nav><p class="muted f6 tc mb0">Using <a class=font-mono href=https://github.com/johanbrook/johanbrook.com/commit/fbe890c24b3a00e71c22da6ab742448a800bddcd>fbe890c</a> — built at <time>2023-01-30T20:58:49.068Z</time> — web 1.0 and 2.0 compatible.</footer><script>if(window.location.host!==new URL('https://johan.im').host){window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}};if(window.location.hash==='#skipgc')localStorage.setItem('skipgc','t');if(localStorage.getItem('skipgc')==='t')window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}</script><script async data-goatcounter=https://johanbrook.goatcounter.com/count src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script>
