      <h2>1. Typescript</h2>
<p>I started programming in Java and PHP. Those two worlds were vastly different. PHP stood for
freedom, fun, and anything-is-possible. Java was rigid, hard, and verbose — much because of the need
for <em>types</em> everywhere. However, when I got the Java code to compile, it was <em>usually</em> okay in
runtime (as okay it can be for a 15 year old). Java was heavily used in university, and I grew to
hate it even more. The interpreted languages like PHP, Ruby, and Javascript felt much nicer.</p>
<p>Fast forward to around 2018, and I got the chance to play around with Typescript (and GraphQL) at
work. This was a turning point in my journey as programmer: the types actually helped me. The type
system — although not as “correct” as in Haskell et al — was expressive, flexible, and quite easy to
understand. And the language itself resembled Javascript so much I didn’t think about it.</p>
<p>What I love about Typescript is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the no-nonsense setup:<pre><code class="language-bash">npm i --save-dev typescript
touch script.ts
npx tsc script.ts
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>the backwards compatibility with Javascript: one can gradually add types if that suits the
project.</li>
<li>I’m not annoyed over any particular syntax of the language.</li>
<li>that it’s actively maintained, and the community is growing and full of tools.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Typescript is probably the single piece of software that has made me write better code over the last
few years. I need less automatic tests, less or no linting. It has opened a new world (of types) to
me, and has made me never wanting to go back.</p>
<h2>2. Deno</h2>
<p><a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a> is what NodeJS was supposed to be. I think. It’s a new Javascript runtime
which does a lot of things right. Peruse the Manual and if you’ve written a bit of NodeJS, you’ll
probably find yourself nod along as you read through the Deno docs.</p>
<p>There are a lot of built-in things, and the ecosystem is spreading. Typescript is a first class
citizen. Testing, formatting, and linting are included. Web APIs are available on the server.</p>
<p>Deno fixes so many things in Node which I’d either get annoyed with or work around.</p>
<h2>3. cUrl</h2>
<p>The <code>curl</code> command just works. There are wrappers and replacements which are “simpler” and more
intuitive. But this is one of these cases where I think it’s good to learn the low level tools,
since <code>curl</code> is available on a <em>lot</em> of machines.</p>
<p>I for one appreciate elegant CLI tools which doesn’t make me figure out their fantasy world of
options and arguments. But <code>curl</code> is such a fundamental way to interact with remote data (I use it
for HTTP 100% of the cases).</p>
<h2>4. Lume</h2>
<p><a href="https://lumeland.github.io">Lume</a> is a static site generator (using Deno and Typescript). I
recently moved to it from Eleventy, and before that from Jekyll -&gt; Wintersmith -&gt; Metalsmith. Lume
is the first one which is close to 100% intuitive, and the first one that I’m not annoyed over when
using. I’ve read some of the Lume source code, and it’s lovely: succinct and readable.</p>
<p>Lume does what it does, and does it really well.</p>
<h2>5. Numi</h2>
<p><a href="https://numi.app">Numi</a> is a calculator app, like Soulver, which I use a couple of times per day.
I’ve bound it to be visible when I press <code>cmd+shift+x</code> for quick calculations. I use it for
everything from credit card bills to protein intake calculations. It’s declarative in the sense that
it “does what I think it does”. If I type <code>5% of 100g</code> it’ll output <code>5 g</code>. It has
<a href="https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi/wiki/Documentation">nice documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Numi doesn’t just to maths: it can deal with unit, timezone, and currency conversions too, and many
other things.</p>
<p>This tech isn’t novel, but Numi pulls it off in a minimal packaging, and I love it.</p>
<h2>6. Tweetbot</h2>
<p>I honestly don’t understand why people are using the regular Twitter.com or Twitter clients for
iOS/Android. People complain daily about “The Algorithm”, non-chronological timelines, ads, etc.
etc. Just start using a 3rd party client already!</p>
<p>I’ve used a ton of clients since I joined Twitter. Many of them are now dead because of Twitter’s
big purge (they killed a lot of API functionality and tweaked some legal agreement I think). But
<a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> is still standing, and are actively pushing new features.
I’m a happy subscriber.</p>
<p>The team has always produced super slick designs, and their work is still cool in a world which
doesn’t really do skeumorphism any longer.</p>
<p>Tweetbot for Mac and iOS have all the features I need. It makes intelligent use of gestures on
respective platform, and I can customise things. No ads. No weird sorting or algorithm. It’s
literally how Twitter used to be.</p>
