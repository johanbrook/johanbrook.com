Typescript</h2><p>I started programming in Java and PHP. Those two worlds were vastly different. PHP stood for freedom, fun, and anything-is-possible. Java was rigid, hard, and verbose – much because of the need for <em>types</em> everywhere. However, when I got the Java code to compile, it was <em>usually</em> okay in runtime (as okay it can be for a 15 year old). Java was heavily used in university, and I grew to hate it even more. The interpreted languages like PHP, Ruby, and Javascript felt much nicer.<p>Fast forward to around 2018, and I got the chance to play around with Typescript (and GraphQL) at work. This was a turning point in my journey as programmer: the types actually helped me. The type system – although not as "correct" as in Haskell et al – was expressive, flexible, and quite easy to understand. And the language itself resembled Javascript so much I didn't think about it.<p>What I love about Typescript is:<ul><li>the no-nonsense setup:<pre class=language-bash><code class=language-bash>npm i --save-dev typescript
touch script.ts
npx tsc script.ts
</code></pre><li>the backwards compatibility with Javascript: one can gradually add types if that suits the project.<li>I'm not annoyed over any particular syntax of the language.<li>that it's actively maintained, and the community is growing and full of tools.</ul><hr><p>Typescript is probably the single piece of software that has made me write better code over the last few years. I need less automatic tests, less or no linting. It has opened a new world (of types) to me, and has made me never wanting to go back.<h2>2. Deno</h2><p><a href=https://deno.land>Deno</a> is what NodeJS was supposed to be. I think. It's a new Javascript runtime which does a lot of things right. Peruse the Manual and if you've written a bit of NodeJS, you'll probably find yourself nod along as you read through the Deno docs.<p>There are a lot of built-in things, and the ecosystem is spreading. Typescript is a first class citizen. Testing, formatting, and linting are included. Web APIs are available on the server.<p>Deno fixes so many things in Node which I'd either get annoyed with or work around.<h2>3. cUrl</h2><p>The <code>curl</code> command just works. There are wrappers and replacements which are "simpler" and more intuitive. But this is one of these cases where I think it's good to learn the low level tools, since <code>curl</code> is available on a <em>lot</em> of machines.<p>I for one appreciate elegant CLI tools which doesn't make me figure out their fantasy world of options and arguments. But <code>curl</code> is such a fundamental way to interact with remote data (I use it for HTTP 100% of the cases).<h2>4. Lume</h2><p><a href=https://lumeland.github.io>Lume</a> is a static site generator (using Deno and Typescript). I recently moved to it from Eleventy, and before that from Jekyll -> Wintersmith -> Metalsmith. Lume is the first one which is close to 100% intuitive, and the first one that I'm not annoyed over when using. I've read some of the Lume source code, and it's lovely: succinct and readable.<p>Lume does what it does, and does it really well.<h2>5. Numi</h2><p><a href=https://numi.app>Numi</a> is a calculator app, like Soulver, which I use a couple of times per day. I've bound it to be visible when I press <code>cmd+shift+x</code> for quick calculations. I use it for everything from credit card bills to protein intake calculations. It's declarative in the sense that it "does what I think it does". If I type <code>5% of 100g</code> it'll output <code>5 g</code>. It has <a href=https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi/wiki/Documentation>nice documentation</a>.<p>Numi doesn't just to maths: it can deal with unit, timezone, and currency conversions too, and many other things.<p>This tech isn't novel, but Numi pulls it off in a minimal packaging, and I love it.<h2>6. Tweetbot</h2><p>I honestly don't understand why people are using the regular Twitter.com or Twitter clients for iOS/Android. People complain daily about "The Algorithm", non-chronological timelines, ads, etc. etc. Just start using a 3rd party client already!<p>I've used a ton of clients since I joined Twitter. Many of them are now dead because of Twitter's big purge (they killed a lot of API functionality and tweaked some legal agreement I think). But <a href=https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/>Tweetbot</a> is still standing, and are actively pushing new features. I'm a happy subscriber.<p>The team has always produced super slick designs, and their work is still cool in a world which doesn't really do skeumorphism any longer.<p>Tweetbot for Mac and iOS have all the features I need. It makes intelligent use of gestures on respective platform, and I can customise things. No ads. No weird sorting or algorithm. It's literally how Twitter used to be.</div><footer><p class="f5 comp-grey mt5"><b class=mr1>Keywords</b> <span class=Post-Keyword>lume</span><span class=Post-Keyword>deno</span><span class=Post-Keyword>typescript</span><span class=Post-Keyword>curl</span><span class=Post-Keyword>numi</span><span class=Post-Keyword>tweetbot</span><p class=mt3><a class=btn href=/writings>&LT- More writings</a></footer></article></main></div><footer class=mb3 role=contentinfo><nav><ul class="f6 list-reset mb3"><li><a href=/>Home</a><li><a href=/feed.xml title=Atom>Post feed</a><li><a href=/mind.xml title=Atom>Mind feed</a><li><a href=/credits>Credits</a><li><a href=/changelog>Changelog</a><li><a href=/api.json>api.json</a></ul></nav><p class="muted f6 tc mb0">Using <a class=font-mono href=https://github.com/johanbrook/johanbrook.com/commit/8aabe7df61eb3716ce1bfc406437c7ddddac35a3>8aabe7d</a> — built at <time>2022-11-18T19:55:14.706Z</time> — web 1.0 and 2.0 compatible.</footer><script>if(window.location.host!==new URL('https://johan.im').host){window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}};if(window.location.hash==='#skipgc')localStorage.setItem('skipgc','t');if(localStorage.getItem('skipgc')==='t')window.goatcounter={no_onload:true}</script><script async data-goatcounter=https://johanbrook.goatcounter.com/count src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script>
