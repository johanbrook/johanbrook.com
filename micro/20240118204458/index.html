                <p title="Posted from" class="muted font-sans mb0 f5 target">Koh Lanta, Thailand</p>
            
        </header>

        <div class="prose">
            <p>We arrived to Koh Lanta a few days ago, where we‚Äôll spend the next two months. While I like long stays in locations, it doesn‚Äôt come without risk. Especially when bringing kids. ‚ÄúWill we like it? Will it be boring? Will there be too many tourists? Will we be able to create an everyday life?‚Äù are questions which I‚Äôve had during the days up until arriving. I think this kind of travelling is one part experience and one part ‚ÄúJust Do It‚Äù. For experience: you just have to trust your gut instincts, and also your skills and ability to integrate well and have a good time. The ‚ÄúJust Do It‚Äù part is self-explanational.</p>
<p>Koh Lanta is super so far though. We live just by Klong Dao beach, which is a super relaxed and cool beach: restaurants, bars, and caf√©s on one side, and looooong waves on the other. And yes: there <em>are</em> a ton of tourists (we among them!) ‚Äî mostly Scandinavian ‚Äî but I‚Äôve accepted that now (haha).</p>
<p>A few days in, we‚Äôve found some kind of a rhythm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Early morning, I either sleep in and hang out with the kids, or do exercise (running or gym).</li>
<li>Late morning, either me or my wife gets ‚Äúoff time‚Äù. The other one goes swimming with the kids.</li>
<li>At lunch, the baby sleeps and the older one hangs out inside for some calm time near the A/C. One of us parents
can go outside.</li>
<li>After lunch, we do some activity. For now that list still only consists of‚Ä¶ more swimming üòÖ</li>
<li>Late afternoon, it has gotten less hot outside, and we can hang out on the beach just by the shallow water where
the kids can play and we can bring takeaway thai food, while watching the beginning of the sunset.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I love so far with Koh Lanta:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ease of living. Many things just exist at your doorstep. A decent supermarket, phone stores for prepaid SIM cards, caf√©s, cheap thai food joints, pad thai stands, drug stores. Products of years of mass tourism!</li>
<li>The picturesque beach. I have to pinch myself every morning.</li>
<li>The pleasant locals. Not <em>everybody</em> are super happy and friendly (I reckon also a product of years of mass tourism!), but everybody <em>are</em> helpful and solutions oriented. They love babies so much, by the way. Everybody are smiling and acknowledging our 10 month old baby, who beams back at them. If I would do that back home in Stockholm‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what would happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>For me, I <em>love</em> the heat that comes with tropical weather. It makes me a tad slower, but overall I prefer to be surrounded by warm 30¬∞C air versus mere 20¬∞C air (which we get in Sweden on averege in the summers, it feels like). A/Cs help a lot, sure. But even without them, I‚Äôd just <em>exist</em> in the heat (and swim a lot).</p>
