        <div class="prose">
            <p>I had always been an “anti e-book reader person”, or conversely, “pro physical book person”. In
hindsight, I’m not sure why: the constant argument had been “I’d like to read <em>real</em> books,
please!”. Hold them, carry them, feel them. Etc. etc. It’s 150% the sentimentality around books as
manifestation of a cultural thing that has been around for hundreds of years. The last bastion,
where the digital revolution yet hasn’t been able to put its bits-and-bytes hands on.</p>
<p>It’s also the vanity thing of collecting physical artefacts (and perhaps showing them off). I’m the
first to admit that I like to keep books in my bookshelf! Even though lately, I’ve borrowed more
books from the local library when the titles have been quite rando, as in “hm, I’m not sure I’ll
ever gonna re-read this or recommend it to somebody”.</p>
<p>Anyhow. With e-readers, you lose both the physical sensation and the showing-off of real books. And
it’s amazing!</p>
<p><em>From now on, this text is about Johan being a decade late in discovering e-readers.</em></p>
<p>For a longer trip I’m currently on, I bought myself an e-book reader. It’s a
<a href="https://eu.kobobooks.com/sv/products/kobo-clara-2e">Kobo Clara 2E</a>. I refused Amazon’s Kindles due
to lock-in and dislike of Amazon. I got myself a magnetic cover, and off I went.</p>
<p>Before, I made damn sure this Kobo thing was <em>open</em> enough to transfer these types of ebooks onto
it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Random, free EPubs books.</li>
<li>DRM protected EPub books.</li>
<li>Library ebooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as sampling books out of the Kobo store. It supposedly has millions of books, and after some
sampling, I determined that it had the titles I was going to read during my trip. Perfect!</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.kobobooks.com/cdn/shop/products/B_UK-ANZ-Device_Angled_1080x1080_17130470-23c2-498c-be24-8e5429a7f784_962x962.jpg?v=1691690100" alt="Kobo Clara 2E"></p>
<p>The Kobo reader is really good. It has a great display, kind of water proof, has good battery life
(I’ve charged it once since I got it in mid January, now is late Feburary), a perfect form factor.</p>
<p>The form factor is something I especially appreciate: I can fit it in my back pocket. I don’t think
the display is too small at all (6 inches, 300 PPI). Anywhere when I got a minute over, I can just
haul it up and get some pages read. You <em>could</em> do the same with a physical book, but even a
paperback of 600+ pages will be a bit of a brick to carry around. The result? I read in a much
higher pace, and therefore a lot more books (since January 14th, I’ve read four books for a total
duration of 56 hours). I feel genuinely excited for how this has lowered the threshold for reading
more books.</p>
<p>It’s almost like one of the charms with physical books became its baggage: to physically acquire
them and transport them around. The ritual became a gatekeeping activity for me. With the e-book
reader, it’s as capitalistic and digital as it can be: I find a book in the Kobo store, buy it with
my Apple Pay, and sync it on the device via my account. No more the feels of “opening the first
pages of a freshly bought book”.</p>
<p>Oh, I’ve almost forgot <em>the</em> best thing about ebook readers! The ability to read in the evening in
the bad shared with a partner who <em>does not</em> want to have any lights on!</p>
