            <div class="prose e-content">
                <p>I had always been an &quot;anti e-book reader person&quot;, or conversely, &quot;pro physical book person&quot;. In
hindsight, I'm not sure why: the constant argument had been &quot;I'd like to read <em>real</em> books,
please!&quot;. Hold them, carry them, feel them. Etc. etc. It's 150% the sentimentality around books as
manifestation of a cultural thing that has been around for hundreds of years. The last bastion,
where the digital revolution yet hasn't been able to put its bits-and-bytes hands on.</p>
<p>It's also the vanity thing of collecting physical artefacts (and perhaps showing them off). I'm the
first to admit that I like to keep books in my bookshelf! Even though lately, I've borrowed more
books from the local library when the titles have been quite rando, as in &quot;hm, I'm not sure I'll
ever gonna re-read this or recommend it to somebody&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyhow. With e-readers, you lose both the physical sensation and the showing-off of real books. And
it's amazing!</p>
<p><em>From now on, this text is about Johan being a decade late in discovering e-readers.</em></p>
<p>For a longer trip I'm currently on, I bought myself an e-book reader. It's a
<a href="https://eu.kobobooks.com/sv/products/kobo-clara-2e">Kobo Clara 2E</a>. I refused Amazon's Kindles due
to lock-in and dislike of Amazon. I got myself a magnetic cover, and off I went.</p>
<p>Before, I made damn sure this Kobo thing was <em>open</em> enough to transfer these types of ebooks onto
it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Random, free EPubs books.</li>
<li>DRM protected EPub books.</li>
<li>Library ebooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>as well as sampling books out of the Kobo store. It supposedly has millions of books, and after some
sampling, I determined that it had the titles I was going to read during my trip. Perfect!</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.kobobooks.com/cdn/shop/products/B_UK-ANZ-Device_Angled_1080x1080_17130470-23c2-498c-be24-8e5429a7f784_962x962.jpg?v=1691690100" alt="Kobo Clara 2E"></p>
<p>The Kobo reader is really good. It has a great display, kind of water proof, has good battery life
(I've charged it once since I got it in mid January, now is late Feburary), a perfect form factor.</p>
<p>The form factor is something I especially appreciate: I can fit it in my back pocket. I don't think
the display is too small at all (6 inches, 300 PPI). Anywhere when I got a minute over, I can just
haul it up and get some pages read. You <em>could</em> do the same with a physical book, but even a
paperback of 600+ pages will be a bit of a brick to carry around. The result? I read in a much
higher pace, and therefore a lot more books (since January 14th, I've read four books for a total
duration of 56 hours). I feel genuinely excited for how this has lowered the threshold for reading
more books.</p>
<p>It's almost like one of the charms with physical books became its baggage: to physically acquire
them and transport them around. The ritual became a gatekeeping activity for me. With the e-book
reader, it's as capitalistic and digital as it can be: I find a book in the Kobo store, buy it with
my Apple Pay, and sync it on the device via my account. No more the feels of &quot;opening the first
pages of a freshly bought book&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, I've almost forgot <em>the</em> best thing about ebook readers! The ability to read in the evening in
the bad shared with a partner who <em>does not</em> want to have any lights on!</p>

                <p>Maybe it's because I've spent the past weeks in a beachside environment, with very few worries
besides watching the baby so she won't eat the sand, but I just don't care for a <em>single</em> bit about
new hardware announcements such as the Apple Vision Pro any longer.</p>
<p>It's so relieving.</p>
<p>Not trying to be smug or snowflake about it. I simply feel so <em>beyond</em> those kinds of thought
streams where I spend more than a second checking the said hardware out.</p>

            <div class="prose e-content">
                <p>We arrived to Koh Lanta a few days ago, where we'll spend the next two months. While I like long
stays in locations, it doesn't come without risk. Especially when bringing kids. &quot;Will we like it?
Will it be boring? Will there be too many tourists? Will we be able to create an everyday life?&quot; are
questions which I've had during the days up until arriving. I think this kind of travelling is one
part experience and one part &quot;Just Do It&quot;. For experience: you just have to trust your gut
instincts, and also your skills and ability to integrate well and have a good time. The &quot;Just Do It&quot;
part is self-explanational.</p>
<p>Koh Lanta is super so far though. We live just by Klong Dao beach, which is a super relaxed and cool
beach: restaurants, bars, and cafés on one side, and looooong waves on the other. And yes: there
<em>are</em> a ton of tourists (we among them!) — mostly Scandinavian — but I've accepted that now (haha).</p>
<p>A few days in, we've found some kind of a rhythm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Early morning, I either sleep in and hang out with the kids, or do exercise (running or gym).</li>
<li>Late morning, either me or my wife gets &quot;off time&quot;. The other one goes swimming with the kids.</li>
<li>At lunch, the baby sleeps and the older one hangs out inside for some calm time near the A/C. One
of us parents can go outside.</li>
<li>After lunch, we do some activity. For now that list still only consists of… more swimming 😅</li>
<li>Late afternoon, it has gotten less hot outside, and we can hang out on the beach just by the
shallow water where the kids can play and we can bring takeaway thai food, while watching the
beginning of the sunset.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I love so far with Koh Lanta:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ease of living. Many things just exist at your doorstep. A decent supermarket, phone stores
for prepaid SIM cards, cafés, cheap thai food joints, pad thai stands, drug stores. Products of
years of mass tourism!</li>
<li>The picturesque beach. I have to pinch myself every morning.</li>
<li>The pleasant locals. Not <em>everybody</em> are super happy and friendly (I reckon also a product of
years of mass tourism!), but everybody <em>are</em> helpful and solutions oriented. They love babies so
much, by the way. Everybody are smiling and acknowledging our 10 month old baby, who beams back
at them. If I would do that back home in Stockholm… I… I don't know what would happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>For me, I <em>love</em> the heat that comes with tropical weather. It makes me a tad slower, but overall I
prefer to be surrounded by warm 30°C air versus mere 20°C air (which we get in Sweden on averege in
the summers, it feels like). A/Cs help a lot, sure. But even without them, I'd just <em>exist</em> in the
heat (and swim a lot).</p>

                <p>I was in a bookstore to get a Christmas gift today over lunch. It was an independent, small store —
not one of the big book chains’ shops. Many books had small paper notes with the staff’s personal
thoughts, and many were signed by the authors, who frequently visited the shop on signing events and
book talks.</p>
<p>I just got a really fuzzy feeling entering the small venue, and even more so after chatting with the
sole clerk.</p>
<p>Entering a bookstore is like entering a whole separate universe where time stands still. When I was
travelling around in the world, I would always get to a bookstore when in a new city just to feel
“rooted” — kind of like finding a safe house.</p>

                <p>Finished watching the David Beckham documentary. I <em>know</em> it’s super produced and sanctioned by the
Beckhams and all that. But. I liked it. Especially the ending, where the family hang out in present
day England at their countryside estate. It felt real, in a way (even though again: I <em>know</em> it’s
staged 😄).</p>
<p>It was a cool story arch, even though I guess I appreciated it because of the nostalgia. The <em>feels</em>
when images appeared of Luis Figo, Zidane, Ronaldo, Rio Ferdinand, and Ryan Giggs and the others. I
used to play Fifa 2003 on PC with those players, and they were all around when we were talking
football in school.</p>

                <p>Messing around with the styling and structure here on the website again. I'm so inspired by all the
personal sites I stumble on in my feed. But not inspired enough to actually produce as much content
here as I would love to 😄</p>
<p>Been reading a lot about
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">Web Components</a> recently. They're
having a sort of renaissance at the moment — not sure why this timing actually — much thanks to them
being a tool in the box when building with progressive enhancement. All PE thought leaders are going
on about the beauty of Web Components and &quot;how you don't need any big JS or Virtual DOM libraries at
all!!&quot;. I get that for small, self-contained UI components, but for anything non-trivial, you're
kind of bound to reinvent something inhouse for your app anyway, no? I guess Web Components fill the
hole where you just want to drop a custom element in a piece of markup and have a Web Component use
the element with contained JS and perhaps CSS.</p>
<p>But the idea of &quot;HTML Web Components&quot; is really neat, in the way it enhances existing markup. Like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;convert-currency to=&quot;USD&quot;&gt;10&lt;/convert-currency&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;convert-currency.js&quot; type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// convert-currency.js
customElements.define(
    'convert-currency',
    class extends HTMLElement {
        connectedCallback() {
            // use this.querySelector() and other DOM API methods to convert
            // the text content to the currency from this.getAttribute(&quot;to&quot;).
        }
    },
);
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For server rendered markup, <code>&lt;convert-currency&gt;</code> will render just fine, and <code>10</code> with it. Browsers
will just ignore it when parsing the HTML.</li>
<li>When parsing is done and JS kicks in, we'll &quot;enrich&quot; our custom element with logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>My takeaway is that custom elements and Web Components give us a declarative way to encapsulate
logic (duh, &quot;components&quot; it's in the name), which creates whole new patterns in how to approach
component style architecture but <em>without</em> any 3rd party JS component library.</p>

                <p>The show &quot;Full Circle&quot; on HBO is good. Made by Steven Soderbergh. It uses unconventional camera — a
raw lens from lower angles — which makes the city lights of New York appear &quot;as they really are&quot;.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I watched the series finale of &quot;Little Drummer Girl&quot; (also on HBO). It was so good. Park
Chan-Wook directed it. The late 70s costumes, interior designs, and locations were spot on. And the
characters were nuanced and non-cliché. Gotta continue my John le Carré run now by reading the
novel.</p>

constant gripe with the latter is to have to eat so goddamned much all the time to get any growth

<p>Watched <em>&quot;All Quiet On The Western Front&quot;</em> yesterday. It's a Netflix produced film (but it was super
good!) about a solider in the German army during World War I. It's based on the book with the famous
title, a source of many dad phrasings over the years (dads throwing in the reference &quot;all quiet on
the Western front&quot; in conversations when receiving the question &quot;how do you do&quot;). The film was
amazing in the sense of production, but also (I guess) authenticity (the dialogue is German 💞). The
sheer horror of war was pictured in a deeply touching and soul draining way.</p>

have zero energy for using Twitter's apps. I'm going all in on Mastodon now.</p>
<p>Luckily, the creators of Tweetbot have released Ivory – an iOS app for Mastodon. It's the same look

                <p>hi again.</p>
<p>last week, i was in portugal 🇵🇹 (right on the coast) with the rest of lookback. it was lovely to see
everybody again. the heart is truly filled until next time.</p>
<p>we're going to south africa 🇿🇦 in november! we're gonna be in franschhoek and kalk bay, on the cape.
really looking forward, since a) i've never been in south africa, b) after researching, everything
seem so cool.</p>
<p>for the month long trip, i've made a list of books to read:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Spy Who Came In From The Cold</em>, by John le Carré</li>
<li><em>Grand Union</em>, by Zadie Smith</li>
<li><em>Vargarna Från Evighetens Skog</em>, by Karl Ove Knausgård</li>
<li><em>At the Existentialist Café: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails</em>, by Sarah Bakewell</li>
<li><em>What We Owe the Future</em>, by William MacAskill.</li>
</ul>
<p>just the action of making this list makes me excited.</p>
<p>red hot chili peppers' latest album
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0KJc9ksnoJJsdpQxV3z5i1?si=n5gq6c42Tpm54YKkAY9DlA">&quot;return to the dream canteen&quot;</a>
is so good. i love anthony's smooth vocals, and john's solid guitar. they're so very musical.</p>
<p>i've bought an watch even though i've said i wouldn't. to my defense, it was a) a used one, and b)
i'll only use it for exercising. it's really nice to not bring the phone when running, since i wanna
track how good i do. however, i'm really impressed by the watch so far. it's really a marvel of
engineering.</p>
<p>i watch &quot;house of the dragon&quot; on HBO, and &quot;rings of power&quot; on amazon prime. the former is really
good: even though it doesn't have the intricate storylines from &quot;game of thrones&quot;, i like the acting
and focus on relationships between parents and children. i also appreciate the focus on the
hardships for women of giving birth. &quot;rings of power&quot; is so-so. it feels too CGI, i think, and too
&quot;joyful&quot;. it doesn't have the raw feeling of peter jackson's trilogy.</p>

                <p>lookie here, haven't posted in a while. this is how it goes when you have a full time job, and not
being on parental leave!</p>
<p>for my own memory, these are things i want to check out at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://www.solidjs.com">SolidJS framework</a>.</li>
<li>building a UI frontend for managing static site generators with <a href="https://tauri.app">tauri</a>.</li>
<li>my work-in-progress app for reminding me to get in touch with friends, using
<a href="https://remix.run">remix</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>overall, things are pretty chill. i'm <a href="/reading">reading</a> the autobiography of keith richards, and
i'm actually enjoying it. thought it would be another sleazy rock star bio, but it kind &quot;sounds&quot;
like he actually wrote it. also, he's got a great memory. too bad i want to buy a new acoustic
guitar now, AND an electric one… 💸</p>
<p>i'm enjoying watching the women's euro cup in football. there are so much less free kicks overall,
due to … they're doing less movie tricks i guess? or are just toucher. the quality is super high
(more than a few years ago, they say), and i appreciate it a lot.</p>

bar. one woman came up to the mic, and it <em>looked</em> like she had been through a lot in her life. i

                <p>finished two shows today: Euphoria S02 and Pam &amp; Tommy.</p>
<p>Euphoria is simply amazing. i loved season one. season two is grittier, and while it uses violence,
sex, and drugs to describe the world, it’s always the characters that shine through. i’ve never seen
better acting than zendaya’s performance as rue.</p>
<p>pam &amp; tommy is kinda of a curve ball. i like it! i didn’t think i would. it manages to take a story
(pamela anderson &amp; tommy lee’s stolen sex tape in the 90s) and make a whole series about it. i liked
the sentimental rendition of their mutual love for each other. also, the issue of men vs. women in
terms of leaked nudes is also brought up. “i was in that tape too!”, says tommy. “it’s not the same!
i’m.. i’m.. a woman!”, says pamela. and it’s not just hollow talk: the series actually manages to
showcase how pamela suffered.</p>
<p>i also appreciated the 90s LA vibe ☀️</p>

                <p>i don't think everyone need heavy test runners and framework for every project. a single file with
<code>import assert from 'assert'</code> (node) and a bunch of assertions can suffice for a tiny prototype
project.</p>
<p>if you want more structure, where do you go? the npm libraries <code>tape</code> and <code>tap</code> have ~20
dependencies each. <code>ava</code> has ~40. i don't even want to think about <code>jest</code>…</p>
<p>i'm sure these packages are great for certain things. but here's a minimal test runner i've written:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/johanbrook/598d07fa89357f8577d6d0d6e88747a5">Johan's Test Runner →</a></strong></p>
<p>it works as you'd expect:</p>
<ol>
<li>create a test file.</li>
<li>import <code>test</code> and write test cases.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-ts">import { test } from './_test-helper';
import assert from 'assert/strict';

test('it works', () =&gt; {
    assert.equal(true, true);
});
</code></pre>
<p>i use node's <code>assert</code> for assertions. want typescript support? add <code>esbuild</code> and <code>esbuild-register</code>
as dev dependencies and run tests with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">node -r esbuild-register run-tests.ts
</code></pre>
<p>the runner supports returning promises, as well as printing fancy file names for each test case.</p>
<p>i appreciate taking this approach before jumping to <code>npm install &lt;dep&gt;</code>. it gives me very much peace
of mind, as long as you don't spend too much time maintaining your own tooling.</p>

                <p>my latest favourite cocktail is this gin sour with bergamot and black tea. you've probably felt the
scent of bergamot in earl grey tea or in perfumes. it's a highly aromatic citrus fruit: it looks
like a large, more spherical, lemon. it's also surprisingly hard to find here in stockholm – even
when it's in season.</p>
<p>i found <a href="https://feeders.se/2022/01/20/earl-greyish-bergamott/">this recipe (in swedish...)</a> and got
hold of a batch of bergamots through a restaurant friend. i've translated the recipe to english
below:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/posts/gin-tea-sour.jpg" alt="Gin tea sour"></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5 cl gin</li>
<li>3 cl freshly squeezed juice from bergamot</li>
<li>2 cl earl grey simple syrup (see below)</li>
<li>1 egg white</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Procedure</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Pour gin, bergamot juice, simple syrup, and egg white in a shaker.</li>
<li>shake like hell for a minute. it should create a lot of foam.</li>
<li>add ice cubes to the shaker and shake until the shaker gets cold.</li>
<li>strain into a coupe glass and decorate with something green or tea related.</li>
</ol>
<p>the cocktail will get a lovely orange tea-like colour too!</p>
<h3>Earl Grey simple syrup</h3>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 dl water</li>
<li>2 dl cane sugar</li>
<li>1 bergamot</li>
<li>2 strainers of black, neutral tea</li>
</ul>
<p>(this will make more syrup than you need for one drink.)</p>
<p><em>Procedure</em></p>
<ol>
<li>combine water and sugar in a pot.</li>
<li>add the zest of the bergamot (the outer layer of the peel, save the fruit with its juice for the
drink). avoid the white layer beneath.</li>
<li>put everything to a boil for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>remove from the heat, add the tea strainers with black tea.</li>
<li>let it sit for at least 5 minutes. it should gain a strong flavour.</li>
<li>remove the strainers and let the syrup cool.</li>
<li>strain (to remove the bergamot zest) and pour the syrup into a small bottle and store in the
fridge.</li>
</ol>
<p>i think the simple syrup is as best the first few days, but mine has lasted over a week now. just
don't forget it in there…</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Banana.</strong> they're full of vitamins, fibers, and natural sugars. they provide the best energy,
and are easy to a) carry around, b) peel. they're perfect.</li>
<li><strong>Mango.</strong> whenever i get to pick flavours for (let's say) ice cream, i always pick mango (or a
combo of mango + something else). they <em>are</em> the best tropical fruits when it comes to flavour.
they're less easy to peel and deal with than a banana</li>
<li><strong>Clementine/Satsuma/Tangerine.</strong> easy to handle and somewhat easy to peel. the best of juices,
and full of vitamins. makes the day brigher.</li>
<li><strong>Pear.</strong> sweeter than apples, with a soft, moist flesh full of fibres. they can be watery
though, so not as rich as mangoes and bananas.</li>

                <p>i love this quote from Nils van der Poel (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it's important to understand that you're not doing it for a gold medal. <strong>Regardless of
which life you chose to live, you will sacrifice something, that's the way it is.</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you go in one direction, you also choose to not go in all other directions at the same
time. It's the basic precondition for going anywhere at all.</p>
<p>But on the path you take, you will experience fantastic things, even though it's uphill there will
be a great view when you're at the top, and that's what makes it worth it, to be on this journey
with people you love. It doesn't matter that much where the journey ends. A movie with a sad
ending is also a good movie - and a movie with a nice ending makes you happy.</p>
<p>I'm very happy for this medal around my neck, and for getting all the way here. But why do you do
it? I don't think you get to pick your dreams, they pick us. It's up to us to realize them or not,
and it seems like people who try to realize their dreams are happier.</p>
</blockquote>

olympics.</p>

                <p>i'm switching to sublime text from vs code as main code editor, and man – it's much more config to
do before it's usable to me. vs code follows more of a &quot;batteries included&quot; and &quot;sensible defaults&quot;
approach.</p>
<p>this is my behavioural config (typography stuff removed):</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;create_window_at_startup&quot;: false,
    &quot;draw_indent_guides&quot;: true,
    &quot;enable_tab_scrolling&quot;: false,
    &quot;ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save&quot;: true,
    &quot;highlight_modified_tabs&quot;: true,
    &quot;highlight_line&quot;: true,
    &quot;remember_open_files&quot;: false,
    &quot;translate_tabs_to_spaces&quot;: true,
    &quot;shift_tab_unindent&quot;: true,

        &quot;.Trash&quot;,
        &quot;.Trash-*&quot;,
        &quot;node_modules&quot;,
        &quot;build&quot;
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>the last one is especially interesting. as of january 2022, there's <strong>still no way to tell sublime
to ignore files in <code>.gitignore</code></strong>. sublime should hide/gray out the files/folders in the sidebar,
and <em>not</em> make them appear in the quick open dialog. so i have to add folders such as <code>node_modules</code>
and <code>build</code> to the global config. people tell me to use some plugin (<code>sublime-gitignorer</code>), but
meh... <a href="https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues/2787">this issue</a> from 2019 is still open.</p>
<p>then i couldn't get the <code>editorconfig</code> plugin to work. i tried changing <code>indent_size</code> in my
<code>.editorconfig</code> file, but the change wasn't reflected in the editor. joy.</p>
<p>then i realised that the typescript in sublime 4 isn't really &quot;support&quot;: it's more &quot;the syntax
highlighting&quot; is working. one has to install a typescript package for the Language Server Plugin for
intellisense (completions, etc) to work.
<a href="https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/typescript-is-not-there-yet-to-be-called-supported/58768">people don't like this</a>.</p>
<p>then i installed prettier along with the sublime plugin, but formatting on every save isn't viable
since it's <em>very</em> slow. somebody online said that vs code's prettier extension is keeping long
running node processes instead of spawning a single one for each save. sublime's plugin is evidently
not doing that. may have to check out <a href="https://github.com/dprint/dprint-sublime">dprint</a>, but that
plugin isn't even out in package control yet. hehe.</p>
<p>then there are these small annoyances like i can't do <code>backspace</code> to delete a file when it's focused
in the sidebar. or hit <code>enter</code> to rename it. but no can do. like, what?! this is standard file
explorer shortcuts? i timeboxed 5 min to find a keybinding but couldn't. i guess my mental model
from atom and vs code differs from sublime's.</p>
<p>i'd really like more visual cues in the sidebar file tree about modified or added files, like vs
codes does. makes it a lot easier to navigate.</p>
<hr>
<p>so is switching worth it? sublime is <em>so</em> much faster than the electron based editors it's
ridiculous. when i'm comparing opening this repo's folder with <code>code .</code> and <code>subl .</code> from the
command line, i understand how gaslighted i've been with the electron editors. sublime just flashes
and it's open while vs code is busy booting another chromium app or whatever it's doing.</p>
<p>but i dislike having to carry around a set of plugins and settings when i switch computers. vs code
has this nice settings sync feature built in, but i'm 100% sure i need to sort that out myself for
sublime with some esoretic github gist based thing…</p>
<p>maybe <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/">Jetbrains Fleet</a> will be The One editor: native, without
bloat, and configurable?</p>
<p>if anybody uses any life saving plugins for sublime, please <a href="/contact">give me a shout</a>.</p>

                <p>i love creating playlists. it's like the lost art of making mixtapes for yourself of somebody else.
even though Spotify (and other services surely) have invested <em>a ton</em> content curation, i still love
my own hand made playlists. spotify, for instance, have a lot of both automated and handmade
playlists for a myriad of occasions. they're kinda niche and cool, but… i still think they're a bit
bland.</p>
<p>what i appreciate is that it's a constant, living project. this categorisation builds up over time
as i discover new material, and i'm now wired to place it in a playlist if i like the track. good
for future johan and others.</p>
<p>here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Ldhvei26A52VXc1ErGFE3?si=7784bde2b4864c83">Johan Recommends 👌</a>.
this one has been around since i got a beta invite to Spotify. i dunno, perhaps 2008? the listing
doesn't tell the date of the two earliest tracks added (just a blank column). this playlist is
just a dump of what i'm listening to at the moment. it forms a nice history of what i liked over
the years.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2mtlhuFVOFMn6Ho3JmrLc2?si=01e2e74df939457c">☕ Programming</a>.
music i code to. mostly techno and instrumental.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6sQMuWwPINJiLZUJK4Z3uD?si=c1900108fe7946fa">👌 Feels Good Man</a>.
reggae and dub. i've been listening to this constantly over the past year, haha. i just can't get
over how good, deep, and rich this genre is.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5nh0YK8EONkjzOnbA3BhUY?si=bb2ee94098424d68">💑 Music for Eating</a>
started as a playlist for a dinner in 2012, now it's my general &quot;turn something on 5 min before
guests arrive&quot; kind of playlist. it's mostly &quot;safe&quot;, as in &quot;nobody and their partner will get
annoyed by the songs in here&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7q5ibEnI11LGt6OfPdUiYF?si=71eee722055a42e7">🎶 Music from the Old World</a>.
i curate this one like a mad man. <strong>only</strong> good, timeless songs in here! think &quot;if mankind would
go under tomorrow, what would you save in a box and shoot out in outer space&quot;. this is music that
i think are masterpieces and that has affected my interest in music somehow.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1gogip1RT6OUnbvdnTi6Pl?si=ac2453416add46c0">🍝 Cooking</a>. music

emo periods, travels, and just everyday life.</li>

my brazilian playlist, which i created when i was in Rio. classic bossanova and samba mixed with
brazilian funk.</li>

similar green details around the physical knobs and switches.</p>

                <p>i've bought a new domain for this site! from now on, it's <a href="https://johan.im">johan.im</a>. short and
sweet. johanbrook.com redirects to johan.im.</p>
<p>i appreciate these services/tools soooo much right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloudflare</li>
<li>Fastmail</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloudflare's dashboard is easy to understand and efficient enough to be dangerous — even though i'm
not a DNS/networking/cache elite ninja. Cloudflare might look simplistic compared to beasts like
AWS, but if you look under the hood, they support more than what they show off (perhaps they should
show off more?). example: like the noob i am, i just redirected <code>johanbrook.com/* → johan.im/*</code>. but
the paths after that slash of course weren't kept. so a URL <code>johanbrook.com/writings</code> would just end
up at <code>johan.im</code> (the root). uh-oh. i read in a
<a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/218411427#h_6N5SySNYCjYUUnCKnC1Ea6">help article</a>
that Cloudflare's Page Rules feature supports <em>wildcard referencing</em>. tears of joy! so i could just
do <code>johanbrook.com/* → johan.im/$1</code> to keep those nice paths.</p>
<p>Fastmail's wizard for adding a new custom domain is so lovely. i could even pick Cloudflare as my
DNS manager, and they'd customise the wizard for Cloudflare's dashboard UI.</p>

                <p>the artist Meat Loaf died a few days ago. his album &quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot; was the first album I recall
playing on CD on my brand new music player when I was ~10 years old. that album – and especially the
title track – was absolutely the thing that got me listening to classic rock as a kid, and then went
on to widen my interest in music overall. i have such a strong memory of playing that album in my
old room.</p>
<p>&quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot; was so &quot;grand and majestic&quot;, and the songs were sooo long. a stark contrast to the
pop songs that was around in the 90s. and the guitar solos sure impressed me as a young child!</p>

                <p>hello world. this is me testing my new GUI for posting these small notes. i'll probably write a
longer post about it later.</p>
<p>in a nutshell, i've written a <em>barebones</em> JS client to talk with GitHub's API to post a new file in
this repo. no dependencies used. it was a fun challenge writing old school DOM JS manipulations
again.</p>

                <p>i'm coding together something that will let me write post and notes in my static site from anywhere,
and it's super fun. need to deal with github auth and their api, learning about Cloudflare Workers,
and extending lume as i go.</p>
<p>the idea is to create a new post or note file with a request from an authed github session. not sure
how generic i want to make this code – it could be of use for others. the existing &quot;CMSes&quot; i've seen
for static pages are just <em>too</em> much.</p>

                <p>i've rewrote my site (using <a href="https://lumeland.github.io">lume</a> 💛) and made a ton of tweaks. classic
neverending parental leave chores. it's built with <a href="https://deno.land">deno</a>, which I love even
more. i'm finally free from the node/npm APIs and build systems! everything is much simpler now, and
i should probably write about it in the even more classic post of &quot;i've rewritten my blog&quot; which
usually shows up in January every year.</p>

                <p>Summer is over, after vacation in August down on the Swedish west and south coasts. Weather was
so-so, but it was nice with a change of scenery. We also spent the month of September in Florence,
Italy, which was such a blast. We travelled abroad with our 10 months old daughter for the first
time, and everything went quite well actually (I had expected the worst). I was so inspired by the
stay in Italy, and hope I can bring some of that energy into the day-to-day life back in Sweden.</p>
<p>On Monday I'll officially start my parental leave until April 2022. Scary but exciting. I'm actually
looking forward to just <em>not work</em> for the first time in 7 years. Who knows what kind of person I'll
be after this leave?</p>
<p>I was inspired by the book &quot;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&quot; by Haruki Murakami, so I
want to start running this Autumn.</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to start making my own pasta. I took a pasta making course in Florence, and it was
super fun. So simple! So fresh!</p>

                <p>Last day in the Swedish mountains, after a week of chilling and hiking. I wonder if I'd like living
here for longer periods of time, or if I'd get cabin fever. I think I'd adjust, but friends and
family are far away.</p>
<p>Still learning programming in Rust. Still not 100% sure of what I'm doing when it comes to memory
management, but the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">official guide</a> and
<a href="https://www.possiblerust.com/">&quot;Possible Rust&quot;</a> have been of huge help. Rust feels like a very
&quot;intellectual&quot; language (sooo much language theory has gone into it!), but I'm struck every day of
how friendly the documentation and 3rd party writings on the language are. I think a super good way
of learning Rust would be to actually pair program with some existing Rust programmer you know, in a
non-trivial project. So that you can ask about all the small things you run into, and can be
unblocked and learn forever.</p>
<p>I'm going to be on parental leave from October until ~April 2022. Am nervous, but looking forward.
Will be a bit weird to be off work for 6 months since I started. But I have zero doubts in that I'll
be able to chill in the new role of being a parent 100% of the time. I'll miss coding for work
though, BUT I guess I'll need to find myself a sIdE PrOjEct like everybody else?!</p>
