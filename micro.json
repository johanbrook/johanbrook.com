You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.</p>\n</blockquote>",

With e-readers, you lose both the physical sensation and the showing-off of real books. And\nit's amazing!</p>\n<p><em>From now on, this text is about Johan being a decade late in discovering e-readers.</em></p>\n<p>For a longer trip I'm currently on, I bought myself an e-book reader. It's a\n<a href=\"https://eu.kobobooks.com/sv/products/kobo-clara-2e\">Kobo Clara 2E</a>. I refused Amazon's Kindles due\nto lock-in and dislike of Amazon. I got myself a magnetic cover, and off I went.</p>\n<p>Before, I made damn sure this Kobo thing was <em>open</em> enough to transfer these types of ebooks onto\nit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Random, free EPubs books.</li>\n<li>DRM protected EPub books.</li>\n<li>Library ebooks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>as well as sampling books out of the Kobo store. It supposedly has millions of books, and after some\nsampling, I determined that it had the titles I was going to read during my trip. Perfect!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://eu.kobobooks.com/cdn/shop/products/B_UK-ANZ-Device_Angled_1080x1080_17130470-23c2-498c-be24-8e5429a7f784_962x962.jpg?v=1691690100\" alt=\"Kobo Clara 2E\"></p>\n<p>The Kobo reader is really good. It has a great display, kind of water proof, has good battery life\n(I've charged it once since I got it in mid January, now is late Feburary), a perfect form factor.</p>\n<p>The form factor is something I especially appreciate: I can fit it in my back pocket. I don't think\nthe display is too small at all (6 inches, 300 PPI). Anywhere when I got a minute over, I can just\nhaul it up and get some pages read. You <em>could</em> do the same with a physical book, but even a\npaperback of 600+ pages will be a bit of a brick to carry around. The result? I read in a much\nhigher pace, and therefore a lot more books (since January 14th, I've read four books for a total\nduration of 56 hours). I feel genuinely excited for how this has lowered the threshold for reading\nmore books.</p>\n<p>It's almost like one of the charms with physical books became its baggage: to physically acquire\nthem and transport them around. The ritual became a gatekeeping activity for me. With the e-book\nreader, it's as capitalistic and digital as it can be: I find a book in the Kobo store, buy it with\nmy Apple Pay, and sync it on the device via my account. No more the feels of &quot;opening the first\npages of a freshly bought book&quot;.</p>\n<p>Oh, I've almost forgot <em>the</em> best thing about ebook readers! The ability to read in the evening in\nthe bad shared with a partner who <em>does not</em> want to have any lights on!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I'm <a href=\"https://johan.im/reading\">currently reading</a> the &quot;My Struggle&quot; series by Karl Ove Knausgård.</p>",

We live just by Klong Dao beach, which is a super relaxed and cool\nbeach: restaurants, bars, and cafés on one side, and looooong waves on the other. And yes: there\n<em>are</em> a ton of tourists (we among them!) — mostly Scandinavian — but I've accepted that now (haha).</p>\n<p>A few days in, we've found some kind of a rhythm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Early morning, I either sleep in and hang out with the kids, or do exercise (running or gym).</li>\n<li>Late morning, either me or my wife gets &quot;off time&quot;. The other one goes swimming with the kids.</li>\n<li>At lunch, the baby sleeps and the older one hangs out inside for some calm time near the A/C. One\nof us parents can go outside.</li>\n<li>After lunch, we do some activity. For now that list still only consists of… more swimming 😅</li>\n<li>Late afternoon, it has gotten less hot outside, and we can hang out on the beach just by the\nshallow water where the kids can play and we can bring takeaway thai food, while watching the\nbeginning of the sunset.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What I love so far with Koh Lanta:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ease of living. Many things just exist at your doorstep. A decent supermarket, phone stores\nfor prepaid SIM cards, cafés, cheap thai food joints, pad thai stands, drug stores. Products of\nyears of mass tourism!</li>\n<li>The picturesque beach. I have to pinch myself every morning.</li>\n<li>The pleasant locals. Not <em>everybody</em> are super happy and friendly (I reckon also a product of\nyears of mass tourism!), but everybody <em>are</em> helpful and solutions oriented. They love babies so\nmuch, by the way. Everybody are smiling and acknowledging our 10 month old baby, who beams back\nat them. If I would do that back home in Stockholm… I… I don't know what would happen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For me, I <em>love</em> the heat that comes with tropical weather. It makes me a tad slower, but overall I\nprefer to be surrounded by warm 30°C air versus mere 20°C air (which we get in Sweden on averege in\nthe summers, it feels like). A/Cs help a lot, sure. But even without them, I'd just <em>exist</em> in the\nheat (and swim a lot).</p>",

They're\nhaving a sort of renaissance at the moment — not sure why this timing actually — much thanks to them\nbeing a tool in the box when building with progressive enhancement. All PE thought leaders are going\non about the beauty of Web Components and &quot;how you don't need any big JS or Virtual DOM libraries at\nall!!&quot;. I get that for small, self-contained UI components, but for anything non-trivial, you're\nkind of bound to reinvent something inhouse for your app anyway, no? I guess Web Components fill the\nhole where you just want to drop a custom element in a piece of markup and have a Web Component use\nthe element with contained JS and perhaps CSS.</p>\n<p>But the idea of &quot;HTML Web Components&quot; is really neat, in the way it enhances existing markup. Like\nthis:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;convert-currency to=&quot;USD&quot;&gt;10&lt;/convert-currency&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;convert-currency.js&quot; type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// convert-currency.js\ncustomElements.define(\n    'convert-currency',\n    class extends HTMLElement {\n        connectedCallback() {\n            // use this.querySelector() and other DOM API methods to convert\n            // the text content to the currency from this.getAttribute(&quot;to&quot;).\n        }\n    },\n);\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>For server rendered markup, <code>&lt;convert-currency&gt;</code> will render just fine, and <code>10</code> with it. Browsers\nwill just ignore it when parsing the HTML.</li>\n<li>When parsing is done and JS kicks in, we'll &quot;enrich&quot; our custom element with logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My takeaway is that custom elements and Web Components give us a declarative way to encapsulate\nlogic (duh, &quot;components&quot; it's in the name), which creates whole new patterns in how to approach\ncomponent style architecture but <em>without</em> any 3rd party JS component library.</p>",
