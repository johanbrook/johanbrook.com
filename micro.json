For experience: you just have to trust your gut instincts, and also your skills and ability to integrate well and have a good time. The &quot;Just Do It&quot; part is self-explanational.</p>\n<p>Koh Lanta is super so far though. We live just by Klong Dao beach, which is a super relaxed and cool beach: restaurants, bars, and caf√©s on one side, and looooong waves on the other. And yes: there <em>are</em> a ton of tourists (we among them!) ‚Äî mostly Scandinavian ‚Äî but I've accepted that now (haha).</p>\n<p>A few days in, we've found some kind of a rhythm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Early morning, I either sleep in and hang out with the kids, or do exercise (running or gym).</li>\n<li>Late morning, either me or my wife gets &quot;off time&quot;. The other one goes swimming with the kids.</li>\n<li>At lunch, the baby sleeps and the older one hangs out inside for some calm time near the A/C. One of us parents\ncan go outside.</li>\n<li>After lunch, we do some activity. For now that list still only consists of‚Ä¶ more swimming üòÖ</li>\n<li>Late afternoon, it has gotten less hot outside, and we can hang out on the beach just by the shallow water where\nthe kids can play and we can bring takeaway thai food, while watching the beginning of the sunset.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What I love so far with Koh Lanta:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ease of living. Many things just exist at your doorstep. A decent supermarket, phone stores for prepaid SIM cards, caf√©s, cheap thai food joints, pad thai stands, drug stores. Products of years of mass tourism!</li>\n<li>The picturesque beach. I have to pinch myself every morning.</li>\n<li>The pleasant locals. Not <em>everybody</em> are super happy and friendly (I reckon also a product of years of mass tourism!), but everybody <em>are</em> helpful and solutions oriented. They love babies so much, by the way. Everybody are smiling and acknowledging our 10 month old baby, who beams back at them. If I would do that back home in Stockholm‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I don't know what would happen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For me, I <em>love</em> the heat that comes with tropical weather. It makes me a tad slower, but overall I prefer to be surrounded by warm 30¬∞C air versus mere 20¬∞C air (which we get in Sweden on averege in the summers, it feels like). A/Cs help a lot, sure. But even without them, I'd just <em>exist</em> in the heat (and swim a lot).</p>",

But not inspired enough to actually produce as much content here as I would love to üòÑ</p>\n<p>Been reading a lot about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components\">Web Components</a> recently. They're having a sort of renaissance at the moment ‚Äî not sure why this timing actually ‚Äî much thanks to them being a tool in the box when building with progressive enhancement. All PE thought leaders are going on about the beauty of Web Components and &quot;how you don't need any big JS or Virtual DOM libraries at all!!&quot;. I get that for small, self-contained UI components, but for anything non-trivial, you're kind of bound to reinvent something inhouse for your app anyway, no? I guess Web Components fill the hole where you just want to drop a custom element in a piece of markup and have a Web Component use the element with contained JS and perhaps CSS.</p>\n<p>But the idea of &quot;HTML Web Components&quot; is really neat, in the way it enhances existing markup. Like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;convert-currency to=&quot;USD&quot;&gt;10&lt;/convert-currency&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;convert-currency.js&quot; type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// convert-currency.js\ncustomElements.define('convert-currency', class extends HTMLElement {\n    connectedCallback() {\n        // use this.querySelector() and other DOM API methods to convert\n        // the text content to the currency from this.getAttribute(&quot;to&quot;).\n    }\n})\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>For server rendered markup, <code>&lt;convert-currency&gt;</code> will render just fine, and <code>10</code> with it. Browsers will just ignore it when parsing the HTML.</li>\n<li>When parsing is done and JS kicks in, we'll &quot;enrich&quot; our custom element with logic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My takeaway is that custom elements and Web Components give us a declarative way to encapsulate logic (duh, &quot;components&quot; it's in the name), which creates whole new patterns in how to approach component style architecture but <em>without</em> any 3rd party JS component library.</p>",
